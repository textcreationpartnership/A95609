            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Finally my Brethren, bee perfect, bee of one mind, live in peace, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt the form of ſound words, and the profeſſion of the faith without wavering, conſidering one another to provoke unto love and good works.</hi> Not <hi>forſaking the aſſembling of your ſelves together as the manner of ſome is: But rather, Brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, ſupport the weak, bee patient towards all men: Pray without ceaſing, in every thing, Give thanks.

               <hi>The</hi> Sixt <hi>is the</hi> Wilderneſſe of Conviction unto Converſion, <hi>whereupon follows ſpiritual</hi> Conſolation. <hi>Compare</hi> Ezek 20.35, 36, 37, 38, <hi>with</hi> Hoſ. 4.14. I will bring you into the Wilderneſſe <hi>&amp;c. in the former;</hi> I will allure her, and bring her into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and there will I ſpeak comfortably to her, <hi>in the latter; wherein is ſome difficulty and diſcrepancy amongſt Interpreters;</hi> Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius <hi>reads it,</hi> Cum deduxero, &amp;c. <hi>and ſo</hi> Junius <hi>refers it to the third verſe of the Chapter; that is, ſaith hee,</hi> when I have afflicted

Mr. Burroughs on the place recites a</hi> Jewiſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, <hi>whereof, hee ſaith, hee hath read.</hi> Their Bridegrooms and Brides uſed on their Mariage-days to go forth together into the fields, and there to ſing their Love-ſongs, and to ſolace each other with conjugal delights, and at length the bride uſed to return home into the City, leaning upon her Bridegroom; <hi>which Cuſtom, ſaith hee, the</hi> Scripture ſeems to favour, <hi>and ſo quotes our Text,</hi> Cant. 8.5. <hi>wherein hee expreſſeth himſelf but</hi> conjecturally. <hi>But why ſhould ſuch places bee called a Wilderneſſe? ſaith hee,</hi> either becauſe they were Champain dry Grounds; <hi>Or however, bee the places what they will bee, this is certain, ſaith hee,</hi> that by this ceremony God would mind them of his bringing them from the Wilderneſſe of the Land of Egypt; <hi>in this hee expreſſeth himſelf</hi> dogmatically. <hi>It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Reaſon <hi>that hee renders, and his</hi> Improvement <hi>is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; ſuppoſing the truth of the ſtory, which I would readily do, did I but know that the Authority of the</hi> Relator (<hi>who is</hi>

               </gap>) <hi>were like the</hi> Reciters, whoſe praiſe is in all the Churches. <hi>Which Cuſtom, if ſuppoſed with the reaſon aſſigned, doth yet leave me a</hi> ſufficient ground-work <hi>to the enſuing Diſcourſe, for who knows not that the</hi> Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Land of Egypt <hi>is a clear type of</hi> the Deſolate ſtate of ſinners by reaſon of ſin, <hi>even as the</hi> Houſe of Egypt <hi>is of their</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under Satan? <hi>Elſe what enforcement lyes upon Us (who never were, wee, or our fathers, in that</hi> Egypt literally taken, <hi>or in that</hi> Pharaohs houſe of Bondage) <hi>to keep the</hi> Commandements, <hi>from that</hi> preface <hi>to the</hi> Decalogue, <hi>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee</hi> out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I have rather judged thoſe two Scriptures, as I have laid them together, to expound each other. Inaſmuch as it is evident, that (though</hi> Hoſeah <hi>Propheſied</hi> before the Captivity, <hi>and</hi> Ezekiel in it, <hi>who being</hi> nearer <hi>the</hi> deliverance <hi>ſees more into the</hi> method <hi>of its accompliſhment, yet) both Prophets do</hi> de induſtriâ <hi>declare the</hi> ſelf-ſame Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Saith Hoſeah,</hi> There will I comfort them, &amp;c. <hi>Saith Ezekiel,</hi> There will I accept them, there will I accept you with a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, v. 40, 41. <hi>But what is the</hi> Order <hi>of the fulfilling of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?
<pb facs="tcp:115802:8"/> Why, Their</hi> Conſolation <hi>comes after</hi> Converſion, v. 37, 38. Ile bring you (by cauſing you to paſſe under the rod) into the bond of the Covenant, and I will purge out the Rebels, and them that tranſgreſſe. <hi>And this their</hi> Converſion, <hi>how comes it but by</hi> Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? ver. 35, 36. Ile bring you into the Wilderneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (<hi>which, according to Expoſitors, is to bee underſtood of their</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, <hi>who were unto them as a</hi> thorny Wilderneſs) and there will I plead with you face to face, like as I pleaded with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Wilderneſſe <hi>&amp;c. (i. e.</hi> until you remember your waies and your doings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and loath your ſelves <hi>&amp;c. verſ.</hi> 43.) <hi>And who knows not that the times of</hi> Wilderneſſe-diſpenſations, <hi>i. e. ſad providences (ſpirituall, or outward, or both) are uſually the Seaſons wherein God faſtens</hi> Conviction? <hi>or that</hi> conviction muſt of neceſſity be in order to Converſion, <hi>and</hi> Converſion <hi>to</hi> ſolid Conſolation; <hi>And thus whom</hi> hee allures into this Wilderneſſe, he doth and will ſpeak comfortably unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Laſt is the</hi> Wilderneſſe of Protection, <hi>and preſervation,</hi> Rev. 12.6. And the Woman fled into the Wilderneſſe, where ſhee hath a place prepared of God, <hi>that is, for her</hi> ſhelter <hi>and</hi> ſecurity. <hi>For though the</hi> Wilderneſs <hi>properly ſo called bee</hi> the habitation of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6, 7.) <hi>and</hi> deſerts <hi>(as was ſaid) bee</hi> Demoniack pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>yet here you have the</hi> Church ſecured from the Dragon <hi>by a</hi> Wilderneſs, <hi>but it is a place of Gods</hi> own preparing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now of theſe ſeveral ſorts of Wilderneſſes, The two firſt,</hi> viz. <hi>local, fall not under the notion of good or evill,</hi> morally <hi>conſidered.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The two laſt which I mentioned, are evidently good, and the ſoul is rather led</hi> into them, <hi>than</hi> out of them, <hi>by</hi> leaning upon the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

            <p>

(you know the ſinner is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the barren fig-tree) if thou doſt not bring forth fruit, the fruit of the ſpirit, thou art a bramble of the wilderneſs. I will not deny the wilderneſs to be in ſome ſenſe fruitful. I ſhould wrong it if I ſhould, and ſo ſhould I ſin alſo; it is fruitful, ſo is ſin, but how?</p>

                     <note place="margin">1. If fruitful.</note>Firſt, The fruit that the wilderneſs bears is wilde fruit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It bears all its fruit unto it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be fruitful unto any other, its rather to the Chimney then to the Table, ſuch is the fruit of ſin.</p>

                  <p>The ſinner himſelf is a wilde plant, ſtark wilde, root and branch, father and ſon, at his firſt conception and throughout his converſation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Thou being a wilde olive-tree wert graffed in;</hi> and therefore certainly the fruit muſt needs be like the fruit of the wilderneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2.

                  <p>Secondly, If the wilderneſs be fruitful,<note place="margin">2. Wilderneſs fruitful to it ſelf.</note> it is fruitful to its ſelf; there the fruit grows, there it ripens, there it falls, pray who is the better for it? Thus it is with thee, O ſinner, if thou bear fruit, it is for thy ſelf, God is never the better for it (as I may ſay) he gets nothing by thy eſtate, he gets nothing by thy policy, he gets nothing by thine induſtry, if thou canſt keep it; none of it promotes his cauſe, none of it maintains his poor, none of it advanceth his praiſe; behold, Thou art the man that art a wilderneſs to the Lord; thy good huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſhall never ſave thee, thy fruit lives and dies, grows and rots with thee; the Lord complains of thee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himſelf:</hi> Though he be never ſo fruitful, yet is he empty, if onely fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to himſelf; though thou be never ſo like a fruitful garden, yet I will count thee a barren wilderneſs, if onely fruitful to thy ſelf.</p>

Wilderneſs brings forth to the fornace</note> it is for fuel, not for food; for their chimney, not their table; the fruit of the wilderneſs is thorns and bryers, bad food but good fuel; ſuch are the fruits of ſin, they are thorns, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As the lily among the thorns,</hi> that is, the ſaint among ſinners; ſuch God will not ſet upon his table, but ſurely put them into his fornace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. <hi>That earth which bears thorns and bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi>

And ſo it is with ſin.</p>
                  <p>Our Savior compares a ſinner under mercy, unto parched ground under ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.6. good ſeed is ſown in parched grounds, and for lack of moiſtures there it dies; the dew falls

Oh! how hath the Lord in theſe times crumbled the ſcorched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men to pieces, yet how few are melted? The Lords people are a melting people, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.14. <hi>My heart is like wax, it is melted within my bowels,</hi> a great difference; their heart is like wax, other mens like the wilderneſs: The more the Sun ſhines upon the wax, the more it ſoftneth it; the more it ſhines upon the wilderneſs, the more it ſcorcheth and hardens it: Now ſpeak ſoul, Art thou like wax under a judgement, a mercy, a ſermon? or art thou like a wilderneſs?

It is termed <hi>The wilderneſs where there is no man:</hi> There you may meet with beaſts, ſavage beaſts, that make it their buſineſs to deſtroy one another, and thee too; but ſaith the Text, <hi>There is no man there:</hi> So in the ways of ſin, you may meet with Devils and Drunkards, Whoremongers, Sabbath-breakers, Murtherers, Thieves and Hypocrites, that make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deſtroy one anothers ſouls, and thine too, but thou ſhalt meet with no good company to comfort thee, to direct thee,<note place="margin">No God.

O Saints, ſince through the Lords grace (I ſcarce can imagine how) we live by them without being deſtroyed of them; O let us have as little converſe as poſſible, no ſinful converſe with them, leſt we be deſtroyed with them; Men do not uſe to converſe with wilde beaſts, except upon an advantage to tame them: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe thou as little as is poſſible with ſinners, unleſs upon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to convert them. <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> one man is a wolf to another, a proverb moſt true in that ſenſe which is moſt ſpiritual. Thus is ſin a wilderneſs, a way for beaſts and not for men. How deſolate and diſmal are thy pathes, O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? you have this character of the wilderneſs with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9 12. <hi>A wilderneſs burnt up, that none paſſeth through:</hi> you ſay that's a dangerous ill road indeed, where there is never an honeſt man upon the way.

But and if he weep, maiſt not thou tremble?

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The wilderneſs is deſolate and comfortleſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115802:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> and proviſionleſs, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27.10. <hi>deſolate like a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> Jer. 12.10. <hi>a deſolate wilderneſs, Zeph.</hi> 2.19. <hi>A deſolation like a wilderneſs:</hi> And God expreſſing the extremity of judgement when it ſhould be higheſt, threatneth Iſrael that he will make it <hi>deſolate,</hi> yea, <hi>more deſolate then a wilderneſs,</hi> Ezek. 6.14.</p>
                  <p>The wilderneſs is a deſolation, deſtitute and proviſionleſs, no houſing, no fire, no water, no bread, no clothing to be had, no not in all the wilderneſs; if you light of any food at all, it is wilde and unwholſome food, light and windy food: The Aſs of the wilderneſs is ſpoken of in ſcripture as feeding upon the wind, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. Thus the wilderneſs is proviſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, miſtake me not, I do not mean it is void of all proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that there is no comfortable, convenient, wholeſome, ſubſtantial proviſion: For the wilde Aſſes and ſavage Beaſts there is accommodation, but there is none ſuitable unto man; hear Iſraels complaint made of the wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Wherefore hast thou brought us to die in the wilderneſs,</hi> for there is no bread, neither any water, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to their dialect (for they did uſe to put bread and water, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times water onely for all maner of comfortable accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in that Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.22. <hi>v.</hi> 2. compared with <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11. now ſay they, In this wilderneſs here is neither bread nor water; Manna they had, but that they accounted a light bread. What they in the ingratitude and hardneſs of their hearts ſaid of that Manna, we may truly ſay of this ſpiritual wilderneſs, here is neither bread nor water, <hi>i. e.</hi> no true ſubſtantial comfort, and our ſouls may loathe the light bread. Beloved, we may ſay of the wilderneſs of ſin, That it hath no food at all for us; I confeſs, if we will be beaſts (as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was turned to be) then the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can produce food for us; and upon the account of this truth, I dare affirm that that ſoul that takes up a reſolution to live upon ſin, may take up a reſolution to become a beaſt: What's an unclean perſon that lives upon luſt, better then a wilde goat? What other is a drunken gluttonous perſon that lives upon exceſs, then a ſwine? What difference 'twixt a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115802:16"/> crafty covetous wretch, and a ſerpent of the wilderneſs, that goes upon its belly, and feeds upon the duſt? Whats a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor that feeds upon the blood of Saints, better then a Lion that feeds upon the blood of Lambs? What is a roaring, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ranting wilde ſinner, better then the wilde aſs of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that ſnuffs up the wind at her pleaſure? If you wil live upon ſuch diet, you muſt turn beaſts; but if you wil be men, you muſt look after higher proviſions then the wilderneſs can afford you. The bread of the wilderneſs is light bread, thy ſoul muſt loath it: All the proviſions that the ſinner by ſin makes for himſelf, are wilderneſs proviſions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>He laboreth for the wind all his days, he eateth in darkneſs:</hi> The food that he takes all his labor and pains about (in the travel of ſin) 'tis at beſt windy food: Oh! <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains of ſinners ſadly upon this occaſion, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for that which ſatisfies not?</hi> If we had onely bodies, ſin happily might ſatisfie us, though its meats be but light and empty proviſions; but we have ſouls, and ſouls will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſuch light bread; I appeal to all your conſciences, were ye ever yet ſatisfied at a feaſt of the wilderneſs? I do not ask you, were you ever filled? I know this windy meat can fill, and clog and burthen, but ſatisfie it cannot: And hence it comes to paſs, that as its ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> the longer they continued in the wilderneſs, the more their carkaſes ſhould waſte, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Your carkaſes ſhall waſte, and you ſhall fall in this wilderneſs, and you ſhall wander forty years, until your carkaſes be waſted:</hi> So this is Gods diſmal doom, upon impenitent ſinners, the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to live many a year, and the longer they live, the more do their ſouls waſte, till they come at length to be quite ſpent in ſin, and then they fall in the wilderneſs. Men that live upon ſin, the longer they live, the leaner and more car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſe-like do their ſouls grow: Haue you not ſeen ſome <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> carkaſes, ſo ſpent and waſted for want of proviſion, that although they were not quite dead, yet their hands were faint, their knees were feeble, ſo far ſpent, that they were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115802:17"/> grown quite mindleſs of food, they had not a tongue to ask it of the paſſers by, not a mouth or ſtomack to receive it: Oh! thus it fares with poor ſinners, that have fed out their time in the wilderneſs of ſin; at length they have not ſo much as an hand or a foor, or a heart to ſtrive, they have not ſo much as a tongue to beg, or a mouth to receive any of thoſe proviſions, that the Lord hath made for poor ſouls in Jeſus Chriſt: Thus is the wilderneſs proviſionleſs as for food.</p>
                  <p>As for raiment what you have, the wilderneſs, the thorns, the brambles can rend away, and tear from you, but all the wilderneſs cannot help you with one garment; So it is with ſin, if you have any cloathes on any good parts or good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as they call it) the thorns, and brambles, and temptations of ſin can tear them off (Oh! how many gallant parts and good natures hath ſin rent to pieces?) but if you be naked, you muſt walk naked for all ſin; ſin can ſtrip you, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clothe you; you are all naked whileſt you are bewildred, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>and there is none to help you:</hi> Therefore till you come out of the wilderneſs leaning upon Chriſt, and have gotten him up on whom you lean, to caſt his skirt over you, you walk naked, and God ſees your ſhame; there is no rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be had for the ſoul, but onely where Chriſt keeps his Markets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. and ſo for other accommodations; all which being thus, makes me ſadly ſay, Sin is a wilderneſs, that is, proviſionleſs: O how evil is ſin to men? and which is ſaddeſt of all yet, yet are men kinde to ſin; Sin cannot feed you, and yet ſpeak your conſciences, do not moſt of you feed ſin, and cheriſh, and nouriſh ſin? ſin cannot clothe you; O what ſhall become of thoſe men for their courteſie that cover ſin? In a word, ſin cannot make proviſion for you; therefore I beſeech you cloſe with the Apoſtles counſel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Make no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the lusts thereof.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Containeth the two last conſiderations ſhewing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malneſs of wilderneſs-ſin, becauſe both are wayleſs, waste and husbandleſs: As alſo the application of the firſt conſideration: Exhortation, Labor to finde Christ to thy ſoul a Gardiner to make thee fruitful.</head>
                  <p>FIfthly, The wilderneſs (as it thus proviſionleſs,<note place="margin">The wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wayleſs</note> upon which account there is no encouragement to abide in it) ſo alſo is it wayleſs, there is no way to get out of it: This, vain Poets could conclude as the moſt diſmal tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> when they were to go <hi>per avia,</hi> that is, wayleſs places; and this indeed the holy Ghoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as alike diſmal to the people and princes of the earth, whom God thus puniſheth, <hi>Job</hi> 12.24. <hi>He cauſeth them to wander in a wilderneſs where there is no way:</hi> And thus it is with ſin; you are not to think that there are no ways in the wilderneſs; there is (as you read) the track to the Lions den and Leopards mountain, there are ways further into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, but there is no good way, no right way, no way out again, no peaceable and ſecure way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, too many ways of ſin and into ſin, but there is not one good way amongſt them all: Sin acquaints ſinners with ten thouſand ways, and yet amongſt them all, <hi>the way of peace have they not known,</hi> Rom. 3.17. The ways of ſin are ways to the Lions den, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Prov. 7.27. <hi>Her houſe is the way to hell,</hi> and Prov. 5.5. <hi>Her feet go down to death, her ſteps take hold on hell:</hi> Leaſt thou ſhouldſt ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable; ſhe hath ways great ſtore, but not ſo much as one good living way, as one foot-path of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all; therefore (as we are to ſhew afterwards) though ſin hath as many ways as the wilderneſs, yet may we in the ſame ſenſe that the holy Ghoſt calls the wilderneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out way, conclude ſin wayleſs: If you will have it, the ways
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115802:18"/> of ſin are wayleſs ways; ſo that as one ſaith of the way to the Lions den:
<q>
                        <l>—veſtigia terrent</l>
                        <l>Omnia te adverſum ſpectantia, nulla retorſum:</l>
                     </q> So ſaith the holy Ghoſt of ſin (many beaſts went to the Lions den, but none return back again) <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.19. <hi>None that go to her return again, neither take they hold of the pathes of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is waſte and husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</note>Laſtly, 'Tis diſmal, becauſe waſte and husbandleſs, and ſo is the whole region of ſin; you have the wilderneſs and waſte places as importing one and the ſame thing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.3. <hi>The Lord will comfort all her waste places, and make her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs like Eden;</hi> yea, you have waſte the character of the wilderneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10. <hi>In a deſert land, and in the waſte howling wilderneſs:</hi> and ſurely it muſt needs be ſo, if that be true which we have heard Scriptures already ſpeak, <hi>In the wilderneſs there is no man,</hi> Job 38.26. no man to plant, no man to pluck up, no man to plough, no man to ſowe, how ſhould it be but waſte?</p>
                  <p>In this as in the reſt is ſin a diſmal wilderneſs, there are no proviſions there, as you have heard, for it is deſolate; there are none like to be, for it is waſte and deſert: The plain Engliſh of the word <hi>deſert</hi> is what God expounds it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.10. <hi>The habitation forſaken and left like a wilderneſs;</hi> Therefore when any ſoul through ſin is a wilderneſs, you may write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſoul <hi>deſert,</hi> the Lord hath forſaken it. This is a ſad conſideration when the ſoul goes on a long time in ſin, and then God comes with a judicial act, and doth (as it were) bind it in its ſins; The ſoul ſaith, I am willing to be as a wilderneſs unto God, unfruitful to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God ſaith, If thou wilt be a wilderneſs, thou ſhalt alſo be a deſert, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee: Thus God threatens for ſin to ſet Jeruſalem, and make her as a wilderneſs, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.2. Now this is moſt ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, when the ſoul hath been under the pains and charges of the Lord; as you ſay, this piece of ground I have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115802:18"/> plough'd, ſown thus often, tryed thus long; and it hath brought me forth nothing anſwerable to mine expectations; I have loſt, ſay you, my time, toil and coſt about it, and now you caſt it up,<note place="margin">So the barren Fig tree: <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.19.</note> (as <hi>God gave them up: Pſalm</hi> 81.12.) Let what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it, you will never look after it more. Now is this ground left DESERT.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord telleth, <hi>Iſai</hi> 5. what husbandry he had beſtowed upon <hi>Iſrael, his Vineyard, v.</hi> 7. which yet brought forth none but wilderneſs-fruit, <hi>viz. wilde Grapes, v.</hi> 4. <hi>Ile tell you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>what I will do with it: I will take away the Hedg, and it ſhall be eaten up, and break down the Wall, and it ſhall be trodden down; I will lay it waſte, it ſhall not be pruned, nor digged; but there ſhall come up Briars and Thorns, and I will command the Clouds that they rain no rain upon it, v.</hi> 6. And O, what a <hi>diſmal Wilderneſs</hi> muſt the ſoul needs be, when the Lord ſhall thus forſake it! There is none to <hi>plant, prune,</hi> or <hi>protect</hi> it; no <hi>word</hi> or <hi>ſpirit</hi> to <hi>water</hi> it; it muſt needs follow, that it ſhall be <hi>laid waſte,</hi> and <hi>eaten up,</hi> and <hi>trodden down,</hi> and nothing but <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> ſhall grow there. How ſad inſtances hereof have we in ſome that have lived long under Goſpel-means, But are not thereby become as a <hi>Garden!</hi> Are they not as a <hi>Wilderneſs?</hi> Yea, of all others the moſt ſharp and thorny: and no wonder, ſince <hi>they are left of the Lord, and deſert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo then that the <hi>Wilderneſs of Sin</hi> is ſo <hi>diſmal,</hi> becauſe <hi>fruitleſs, moiſtureleſs, companionleſs,</hi>

Iſai</hi> 61.3, 11. Again, Chriſt can repleniſh us with fruits of Paradiſe: [Alas! why ſhould we ſavour thoſe <hi>fruits unto death?

To ſay nothing more of the ſad variety of wilderneſs-deaths, he that ſcapes the famine, is pierced through with thorns; he that ſcapes the thorns, is ſtung and bitten with ſerpents; he that ſcapes the ſerpents, is devoured of wilde beaſts; he that ſcapes the Bear, the Lion

To thoſe that come up from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>Firſt Then to thee freind, whoſoever art come up from this wilderneſs, I have a great meſſage from this truth. Surely if if any truth in the world can heighten the thoughts of Saving grace unto thy ſoule. this very doctrin may do it in the higheſt kind: What ſhall I ſay! I am come to call for the expreſſion of that mercy which is beyond expreſſion, thoughts of grace beyond thoughts: Oh the <hi>height,</hi> and the <hi>length,</hi> and the <hi>depth,</hi> and the <hi>bredth</hi> of <hi>that love</hi> which brought thee up from a wilderneſs <hi>ſo long, ſo broad,</hi> ſo <hi>great,</hi> ſo <hi>terrible!</hi> I may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere, <hi>what ſhall we ſay then to theſe things?</hi> Thou wert a wilderneſs, a barren, parched, ſolitary, deſtitute, wayleſſe, waſte wilderneſs; thou art made the garden of the Lord. Thou wert amidſt the famine, thorns, Serpents, ſavage beaſts of this wilderneſs, ready to be devoured, doubly, irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably, everlaſtingly: And yet are thou now come forth out of this wilderneſs, and thy life is given thee for a prey. Thou wert in the great, variouſly-pathed, perplexed, ſtumbling, dark, thorny, ſurrounding waies of this wilderneſs, and yet art thou now in the one, good, living way, the way of peace. Oh! mayſt thou ſay, when I was intangled in the wilderneſs, I did
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115802:36"/> never think, or hope of getting hither? but the Lord hath found me, when I was loſt, the Lord hath led me when I was bewildred. Admire then, for ever wonder at the finding mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the leading grace of God.<note place="margin">1. Admire that God ſhould chuſe thee thence.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Ever retain high thoughts of the electing mercy of the Lord: what, conſideration can raiſe it higher? when I was as a wilderneſs, and in a wildernſes, when I was barren, and when I was loſt, that is, when I was neither fit for ſervice, nor worthy of favour, the Lord was pleaſed to pitch his electing grace upon me: Surely, if we will but grant election, let ſchooles expound it what way they will, this cannot chuſe but lift it up beyond even admiration, that God ſhould chuſe us, when he foreſaw us under theſe Spiritual and ſoul bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings. This is that which in <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe is noted (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not, as I think, I do not) the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which are Gods portion, and the lot of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (as you ſhall find <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9.) now this I ſay, is that whereby he heightneth the thoughts of that mercy, in which he ſingles out <hi>Jacob</hi> for his portion <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He found him in a deſart land, and in the waſte howling wilderneſs.</hi> Surely, this is Spiritually to be laid to heart, though it hath its alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Jacob's</hi> hiſtory in the letter; for neither was all that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Spiritually the Lords people, portion or lot of inheritance: Neither were all they that were the Lords among them, found in that viſible wilderneſs, being all the old ones of them brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the wilderneſs. 'Tis as if the Lord ſhould ſay: <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a wilderneſs, and <hi>Jacob</hi> in a deſert; I found him in a deſert land, that is, he was forſaken, I found him in a wilderneſs which was waſt, that is uſeful unto none! I found him in a howling wilderneſs, that is, amongſt Lions, and Leopards, Beares, Dragons: and yet have I allotted him to be my portion and inheritance: ſo that this Scripture is in ſubſtance (in my thoughts) the ſame with that memorial of the Lords dealing with his people in their natural condition,<note place="margin">2. Admire that ever God ſhould bring thee thence.</note> and in ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. <hi>&amp;c. caſt out into the open field, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For ever wonder at the calling mercies of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115802:37"/> Lord. Thou wert in a wilderneſs, that ever God ſhould ſend a Chriſt to call thee thence; wert a loſt ſheep in that wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ever Chriſt ſhould beſtow the pains to look thee out, and to take thee up, to lay thee upon his ſhoulder, and to bring thee home again: O what exceeding great mercy is here! God might have given thee for gone, and though he had found thee in the wilderneſs, yet might he have left thee alone, and left thee as he did ſo many of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>to die in the wilderneſs;</hi> or (which is all one) ſo many of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>to die in their ſins, John</hi> 8.24. but having found his <hi>Jacob</hi> in the wilderneſs, and having choſen him thence for his own portion, he crowns his finding-mercy, with a leading-mercy; his directing, with a protecting mercy: He ſeconds his protection with proviſions, he ſupports and ſupplies: <hi>He found him in the howling wilderneſs, he led him about, he inſtructed him, kept him as the apple of his eye; as an eagle ſtireth up her neſt, fluttereth over her yong, ſpreads abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings,</hi> Deut. 32.9, 10, 11. Thus hath God dealt with thy poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred ſoul; he hath taught thee the way, he hath led thee in the way, he hath protected thee from danger, and as in <hi>verſe</hi> 12. he hath made proviſion for thee: This is the <hi>Song of Moſes,</hi> and truly I am the bolder to make improvement of it to all converts, becauſe it is alſo the <hi>Song of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 15.3. Now Friends, look to it, if after God hath found you thus like <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hath dealt ſo with you, and you inſtead of a thankful, humble, holy, and continual remembrance thereof, with <hi>Jeſurun wax fat and kick</hi> (that's rebel againſt him and grow carnal) and <hi>forſake the Lord, and lightly esteem this rook of your ſalvation;</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 15. know, that it will <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſie,</hi> as <hi>verſe</hi> 16. as zeal is the height of love, ſo is jealouſie of indignation: jealouſie you know, follows upon miſcarriage after greateſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: A man is fearful of his foe, but jealous of his friend; of his boſom friend, of one that he hath done moſt for, is he moſt jealous, if he begin lightly to be eſteemed. Take heed friends: The Lord tells you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.34, 35. <hi>Jealouſie is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115802:37"/> the rage of a man</hi> (and if ſo, ſurely it is the ſury of the Lord) and therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance, <hi>he will not regard any ranſom, neither</hi> will he <hi>reſt content, though thou offer many gifts:</hi> It may be, yea (if God have ſet his love upon thee) it ſhall be that thou ſhalt be ſaved, but thou ſhalt yet pay dearly for thy ſin; thou <hi>ſhalt offer gifts,</hi> and yet <hi>not be accepted;</hi> yea, <hi>many gifts,</hi> and yet not finde thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices regarded; thou wilt never finde the Ten thouſandth part of that ſweetneſs in ſin: Therefore if ever God have brought thee out of the wilderneſs, take heed of venturing in again: If ever God bring thee out, it ſhall be through the thorns and bryars.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for uſe of the point: I have but one thing more upon my thoughts, and that is the taking off the uſe; I would rather call it the abuſe, of ſuch a truth as this is, which ſinners make unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Is ſin a wilderneſs, may a prophane heart ſay,<note place="margin">What uſe ought not to be made of ſins being a wilderneſs.</note> are there thickets, <hi>dark and ſhady places</hi> there? That's it, ſaith he, that I would have; for my part, let who will love it, I hate the light, and care not for coming to it; then what care I though it come not to me? my works are works of darkneſs, my time is <hi>tempus tenebrionum,</hi> the times of Lions riſing for their prey, the twy-light, the evening, the black and dark night: <hi>Is't a wilderneſs? I am glad you tell me of it, 'tis ſo fit for my purpoſe:</hi> I love to go from ſin to ſin, and I was afraid I ſhould never have found ways of ſin enough; never enough cheating varieties, never enough diverſities of uncleanneſs: I am almoſt weary of tracing backward and forward the ſame paths: I am glad I can hear of freſh paths, there I can walk with new delight: <hi>I am glad to hear of ſuch thickets:</hi> Oh! there I can pleaſe my minde with ſecurity, and ſin with ſhelter: <hi>I am glad you tell me of theſe wiles and entanglements:</hi> I hope now you Miniſters ſhall never be able to finde me out; I was afraid of nothing, but leſt theſe thickets ſhould have been cut down, and leaſt the Sun ſhould then look in upon me; leſt a gap ſhould have been made into the wilderneſs, and all your Pulpit-terrors have made an inrode upon me, and either fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115802:38"/> me from my prey, as they have been ſometimes ready to do; or at leaſtwiſe, to have made me eat my prey in fear, and ſo to have ſinned with leſs delight.</p>
                  <p>Poor wretch! Is this it that ſo ſatisfies this prophane phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? That thou haſt now got ſhelter from the ſtorms, and light of God, and that thou ſhalt not now be found out? Thou might'ſt think that, though none could come in to thee to diſturb thee, yet are there enough within thy wilderneſs to devour thee: The Lions are but yet aſleep, not yet rouzed from their den, there's time enough for conſcience to awaken yet, and then what ſhall become of thee? but to let this paſs, Know that;</p>
                  <p>Though ſin be a wilderneſs unto thee, that thou canſt not finde a way to God, yet is it not a wilderneſs unto God, but that God can eaſily finde a way to thee: There are two things remarkable concerning God, with reſpect unto the wilderneſs wherein thou art.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Though thou <hi>hide thy ſelf in the thickets of Carmel, yet will God ſearch and take thee out thence,</hi> Amos 9.3. God knows, and well obſerves all the ſecrecies, paſſages, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and turnings of this wilderneſs of ſin: This is that which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.9. <hi>The voice of the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the forests, and in his temple we muſt ſpeak this unto his glory:</hi> It ſeems the wilderneſs may for a time <hi>cover</hi> thee, but what wilt thou do when the Lord <hi>diſcovers</hi> that? The heart-ſearcher is, you ſee, a ſearcher of <hi>Carmel,</hi> and the heart-diſcoverer, is a diſcoverer of the wilderneſs. This is his glory, which (if you perceive it not in his Temple now) you ſhall reſt aſſured of it, whether you will or no, another day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though thou lie ſecure at the bottom of theſe thickets, and think that no danger ſhall reach thee, yet even there (as his language is in <hi>Amos</hi> 9.4.) <hi>He ſhall commaud the ſerpent, and he ſhall bite thee:</hi> Thou goeſt into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for ſhelter, thinking to bear off ſtorms of wrath and conſcience, by farther ſining; but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.8. <hi>The voice of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115802:38"/> the Lord ſhaketh the wilderneſs, the Lord ſhaketh the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Kadeſh:</hi> What wilt thou now do? A man goes into a foreſt, or thicket, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to keep off the rain that falls in ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler drops, and it doth ſo for a ſeaſon; but by and by there ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a great wind, a ſhaking wind: Who hath the beſt on't now, he that's in the wilderneſs amongſt the thickets, or he that is in the open field? Now that that would have fallen before but in ſmall drops, and this winde would have dried again, falls upon him, nay rather is poured down upon him as it were full viols, and this winde drives it thorow him: Theſe are the direct iſſues of theſe ſhakings of the wilderneſs: Death is <hi>a ſhaking wind to all,</hi> but yet it is <hi>a drying wind</hi> to thoſe that are got out of the wilderneſs, that have an intereſt in Chriſt; but a <hi>drenching wind</hi> to thy ſoul, whoever art in ſin: Conſider this before the Lord ariſe, as he is determined, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.24. <hi>tearibly to ſhake the earth:</hi> I, but ſay you, we ſhall hold together, and chear one another for all this; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Wickedneſs burneth as the fire, it ſhall devour, and ſhall kindle in the thickets of the forest;</hi> yea, Nahum 1.10. <hi>Whileſt they be folden together as thorns, they ſhall be devoured as ſhubble fully dry:</hi> You ſee, the very thickets where the thorns are folden moſt together, ſhall be devoured: This is that which the holy Ghoſt otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth; <hi>Though hand joyn in hand, yet ſhall not the wicked go unpuniſhed,</hi> Prov. 16.5.</p>

                  <p>This I ſhall firſt prove, and then open; I ſhall prove it firſt in General, then by Induction of Particulars: I ſhall

                     <note place="margin">Proof. General.</note>Firſt, Then for proof of the point in General; <hi>viz.</hi> That all unconverted ones, are ſpiritually bewildred ones, even loſt in the wilderneſs of ſin: Hear what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, and the Apoſtle from him: When God looked down from heaven, to take a view of men on earth, to ſee if any, if any I ſay, ſought after God: Hear Gods own language, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 14.2, 3. They <hi>are all gone aſide:</hi> And what is that but to be bewildred?

None better, <hi>no not one,</hi> ver. 12. How emphatically doth he expreſs it? now ſee how amply he proves it.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He proves firſt, That they are a wilderneſs, and that in all maner of latitude: <hi>They are altogether become unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> ver. 12. and what fitter character for a wilderneſs?</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He proves next, That they are in a wilderneſs, and that in as great a latitude.</p>
                  <p>And that firſt, By ſhewing that they are gone out of the right way; <hi>They are all gone out of the way,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by declaring, That being out of it, they have neither wiſdom nor knowledge to finde it any more; for, <hi>The way of peace they have not known,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By giving an account of the ways they are gone into, which is the very character that I have, from Scripture, given you of the waies of the wilderneſs of ſin; <hi>Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and miſery are in their waies,</hi> ver. 16. And I pray, What are waies of deſtruction and of miſery, if the ways of the wilderneſs be not? Now then as the Apoſtle ſpeaking puts us altogether, let us put all that he hath ſpoken together: <hi>They are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether Jew or Gentile</hi> (ver. 9.) <hi>gone out of the way</hi> (ver. 12, <hi>and know no more the way in to peace</hi> (ver. 17.) but inſtead of that way, are in <hi>the ways of miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> (ver. 16.) and now, my Friends, Believe you that this is Scripture? I know that you believe: This you have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115802:40"/> God frequently complaining of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.3. <hi>They and their fathers have tranſgreſſed;</hi> of which word, this is the plain Engliſh: They have both father and childe, one and another, gone aſide out of my ways; then he purſues his complaint againſt the ſame perſons, and calls them <hi>bryars and thorns,</hi> and <hi>ſcorpions,</hi> which are all of the wilderneſs (as you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard) <hi>Though bryars and thorns be with thee, and thou dwelleſt among ſcorpions, yet be not afraid,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>but ſpeak my words unto them,</hi> ver. 7. as who ſhould ſay, I have ſent thee as <hi>a voice to cry in the wilderneſs,</hi> but be thou not afraid. My friends, I deſire to ſpeak it with grief of heart, as the truth of God; there is not one ſoul of you that is <hi>out of Christ</hi> but it is <hi>in the wilderneſs,</hi> that deſtructive and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wilderneſs of ſin: There is not a ſoul amongſt you that <hi>lives out of Christ,</hi> but it <hi>lives in that wilderneſs;</hi> that <hi>dies out of Christ,</hi> but it <hi>dies in that wilderneſs;</hi> and for this, <hi>Oh! that my head were fountains!</hi> that this ſhould be heard of and ſpoken of, and ſo much concern every man, and yet no man lay it to heart!</p>

                  <p>You have heard that murmuring and unbelieving <hi>Iſrael came ſhort of Canaan:</hi> 'Tis the Apoſtles phraſe concerning all unbelieving ones, <hi>That they all are come ſhort of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23. and this you ſhall finde ſadly true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or end where you will, from the childe in the womb and cradle, to the aged in the litter and on the beer; if <hi>not in Christ,</hi> then <hi>in the wilderneſs;</hi> if <hi>ſhort of Christ,</hi> then <hi>ſhort of Canaan:</hi> The familiar expreſſion of that Prophet, who was ſo much in parables, is a wilderneſs, or foreſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the world, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.24.

Saith <hi>Mark, The cares of the world, and the luſts of other things,</hi> and that relates more properly to the needy: what they want, they bewilder themſelves in luſting after. Saith <hi>Luke, The cares of the world, and the pleaſures of this life;</hi> and that relates more properly to the wealthy: what they have, that they bewilder themſelves in taking pleaſure in. They that want, loſe themſelves in the thoughts of what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, and how to reach unto their eſtate, a garment, a gown of ſuch a faſhion, a kitching ſo adorned, a room ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115802:46"/> furniſhed, an orchard, a garden ſo fair and beautiful, Oh! that they had it! Here are bewildering luſts of other things. They that have enough and abundance, loſe themſelves in the thoughts of what they have, how to diſpoſe of it. They can keep Hounds, and Hawks, and race-horſes, and what not? Bauds, and Paraſites to flatter them, and Whores to ſatiate them, and all to bewilder them. Or if they be not wholly ſo vainly diſpoſed as the former, or ſo wickedly as the latter; yet ſtill there are wilderneſs wayes enough. This corner of the houſe muſt be pulled down, and built again in another mode, and this takes up a twelve moneth perhaps, that they cannot tend their ſouls: but they poor fools go aſtray, they know not, they mind not whether: As they are in bed at night, they fall a fancying their building till they fall aſleep, and as ſoon as awake or up in the morning, they muſt look upon their workmen before they look upon their hearts: and when this end is done, the other, end muſt be made ſuitable; when one bewildering way is paſſed through, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are the bewildring pleaſures of this life. You may enlarge according to your own experiences, and whilſt you conſult with them, you will have reaſon to admire that ſuch fooliſh vanities as do, ſhould ſo bewilder your noble and immortal ſouls. And as to the third, The cares of the world bewilder all. Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices may think (when God at a Sermon toucheth their hearts) Oh that I were as free as my maſter is! I would hear Sermons oftener then he doth; and perhaps as ſoon as thy time is our, the world, the ſame wilderneſs, gets thee in; thou haſt a wife, and a ſtock, and a great deal to do, and now wilt thou get out thy ſelf as little, or let out thy ſervants as little as ever thy maſter, thy cruel carnal maſter, would let out thee.

I have very rarely obſerved that any man hath had more time for heaven then another, by having more of earth then hath another. If
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115802:49"/> the rich man can finde time enough from his occaſions to have a leſſon ſet him, or to hear it read, <hi>Good maſter what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> he can by no means ſtay to take it forth; <hi>He went quickly away; for he had great poſſeſſions,</hi> Mat. 19.16, 22. The rich have barns to pull down, and greater to build, and a thouſand more occaſions. Ask them, and ſay, <hi>Come let us go up to Zion;</hi> they muſt needs deny you, their hands are already full of their own occaſions. I have ſeen what time ſome had to take money in, but I have wondred what time they have had to pray in. Or if you turn unto duty, which yet is as ſad, do not the occaſions of the world go along with your hearts. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come, and ſit and hear, but their heart goes after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for rich men.</note> to think, as perhaps you have reaſon to do, if unregenerate you ought to do, that what ever you have gotten, you have gotten it in the wilderneſs. Tis the Lords own notion, not mine. Read <hi>Job.</hi> 24.5, 6. <hi>Behold, as wild Aſſes in the deſert, go they forth to their work, riſing betimes for a prey; the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs yeeldeth food for them, and for their children,</hi> &amp;c. Thou haſt got (thou canſt ſay) an eſtate for thy ſelf, an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for thy ſon, portions for thy daughters; but if thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors or thy conſcience can ſay, thou haſt got it in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that <hi>ſin hath yeelded food for thee, and for thy children,</hi> doſt thou nor think this thought will ſpoil all, in the day that thy wilderneſs ſhall become an howling wilderneſs? Surely
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115802:50"/> it ſhall. Therefore, <hi>Go to now, rich men, lament and howle for the miſeries that ſhall come up on you,</hi> James 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, Tis not more hard for any to get out of the wilderneſs, then for the rich; <hi>as strait as the gate is that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into life, ſo ſtrait</hi> is the <hi>gap</hi> that <hi>leads out of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And ſurely it is not for thoſe that are fat like <hi>Jeſuron, cloathed</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) <hi>with thick clay,</hi> to croud or creep out at ſo narrow an hole. The paſſage is no bigger then a needles eye; therefore one way or another, by loſſes, or ſelf-denial, or contempt of the world, thou muſt be brought to a ſingle thred to go thorough the needles eye. The yong man might elſe have got out of the wilderneſs, but he was too thick to go thorough, <hi>for he had great poſſeſſions,</hi> Mat. 19.22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider what a fooliſh and vain purchaſe it is to grow rich in a wilderneſs; for whilſt an <hi>eſtate is gotten, thy ſelf is lost.</hi> And upon this account, what <hi>would it profit thee to gain the world, whilſt thou loſest thine own ſoul?</hi> Mark. 8.36. This was the folly of that fool, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. He boaſted what an eſtate was his, when that very night it appeared that his ſoul was none of his then; <hi>Whoſe are the things that he had provided?</hi> verſ. 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, Whatever thou getteſt in the wilderneſs, thou ſhalt undoubtedly leave there. The thorns and the bryers of thoſe thickets will never ſuffer thee to go away with thy fleece that grew there. Thus he <hi>that gathereth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midst of his dayes, and in the end ſhall be a fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let rich men learn to chuſe the way of truth, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.30. Yea, <hi>to turn their heart</hi> thereto, and not <hi>to covetouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. Yea, <hi>To rejoyce in the way</hi> (mark the phraſe, <hi>the way) of Gods teſtimonies as much as in all riches.</hi> My friends, Gods <hi>teſtimonies are a way; all riches</hi> without them <hi>are but a wilderneſs.</hi>

So true is that (which God ſpeaks figuratively) in that ſenſe which is moſt ſpiritual, <hi>Sin ſhall have great pain. Ezek.</hi> 30.16. God ſpeaks it of that material Wilderneſs, that is, of the People that dwelt round about that deſolate place; You will finde it as fully and ſadly true of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wilderneſs of ſin, if ever you come to Hell. When <hi>Sin comes to have great pain,</hi> when this Wilderneſs is ſet on fire, that's Hell. Reade <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.47.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee from firſt to laſt, the unregenerate are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually bewildred; young and old, living and dying, they are in a Wilderneſs of ſin. From hence,</p>

When God comes to puniſh mens crooked ways, their crooked hearts are blaſphemouſly ready to reckon Gods ways crooked. If therefore you now reflect how wretchedly crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your own ways have been in treſpaſſing, you cannot think Gods ways crooked in arreſting. The Lord himſelf thus vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates his own righteouſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>In his trespaſs which he hath trespaſſed, and in the ſin which he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall he die.</hi> Blame not juſtice for arreſting you when you die. Ye have been <hi>Trespaſſers,</hi> that is, you have gone out of the way, all your lives.

And what can the Lord ſay other? If (ſaith God) you will not ceaſe treſpaſſing, you ſhall die in your treſpaſs; but if you would turn, (and O that you would) ſaith God, from your tranſgreſſion, it ſhould not be your ruine. Therefore <hi>cast away all your tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <p>THus much for the doctrinal proof of the Point.<note place="margin">Diſcovery of the Point in three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 1. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath to bewilder poor ſouls.</note> We come now to further diſcoverie of what you have heard ſo fully, ſo ſadly proved. I pitch upon theſe three Heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what advantages Satan hath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what pains he takes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what means he makes to bewilder poor ſouls.</p>
                  <p>And what firſt are Satans advantages? The Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. puts us on this. <hi>Leſt Satan</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>get an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of you, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</hi> It ſeems Satan is very carefull to take, and to improve, all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of poor ſouls. And unto what? Why unto his own <hi>devices,</hi> called by the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Wiles or Methods,</hi> or (as we engliſhed) <hi>bewildrings.</hi> You muſt think the ſame thing to be intended in both places, ſo then call them devices or bewildrings, or bewildring devices, which you will; there is advantage that Satan hath, and that Satan takes in order unto them:</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of advantages that Satan hath,<note place="margin">2. Sorts of advantages. 1. Sort from our ſelves. 2. Sorts of them.</note> as to the bewildring of poor ſouls. From our ſelves ſome, others from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from us. There are two great advantages.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our hearts naturally are a wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſubject to tempt, and lead us into the wilderneſs. Therefore you may obſerve this difference of expreſſion. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God complains that <hi>they walk in the counſels of their own hearts.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.24. they <hi>hearkened</hi> not, <hi>&amp;c, but walked in the counſels, and in the imagination of their evil heart.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 11.8. So <hi>chap.</hi> 13.10. Mark their walk, or their way, is that he ſpeaks of. And where is it? Why, <hi>in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115802:57"/> their evil hearts:</hi> here their hearts are made the wilderneſs. And othertimes God complains, that <hi>they walk after the counſels, &amp;c. of their own hearts.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.14. But <hi>they walked after the imagination of their own hearts.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 18.12. <hi>We will walk after our own devices, and we will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one do after the imagination of our own heart.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 23.17. They ſay to every one that walketh after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his own heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here their hearts are become guides to lead them into the wilderneſs. Wonder not then that we are ſo eaſily bewildred ſpiritually, ſince our hearts are not onely a wilderneſs unto us, but tempters alſo, that lie at catch to ſeduce and bewilder us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Our hearts by nature are a wilderneſs.</note>Firſt, then this is Satans great advantage that herein he hath from us, our ſouls by nature are a wilderneſs unto us. Perhaps ſome carnal one might ſay, What do you talk ſo much of a wilderneſs? I ſee none, Where is't? What is't? How can theſe things be? Why look within, and thou canſt not look off of the wilderneſs. Men walk (ſaith God) in their own evil hearts. Why there's the wilderneſs. I ſaid (ſaith God) <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you; but they hearkned not.</hi> Sure you'l grant now that they are in the wilderneſs, when they are out of all Gods ways: and what's that wilderneſs? Where did they walk then? Why, <hi>In the counſels of their evil heart,</hi> and what follows? <hi>They went backward and not forward, v.</hi> 24. Whileſt men and women go aſide from Gods counſels and ways, they go backward, and if you'l ask me where? 'Tis <hi>in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own hearts.</hi> So in <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.7. You have God riſing up early, and proteſting his ways from day to day unto them. And now that God is in ſuch a ſerious poſture, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting God, (whoſe bare word is truth infallible) What hinders them now from Gods way? Why? (ſaith God) 'tis this (their heart is a wilderneſs) they <hi>walk every one in the imagination of their own evil heart, v.</hi> 8. Memorable is that Scripture <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95.8. You have mention of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he was in the wilderneſs provoking God there. But what was it that grieved God, yea grieved him fourtie years? Was it,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115802:57"/> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in that material Wilderneſſe? Oh that was not the worſt of it, but <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>'Tis a people that do erre in their hearts, and they have not known my waies.</hi> Sirs, what ſay you now to this heart-wil-derneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? 'Twas <hi>erring in heart</hi> ('twas heart-bewildring) that kept them out of Gods waies. Hence that ſad, but pregnant expreſſion. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 64.6. <hi>They ſearch out iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> That is, in their Counſells, and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>in their hearts.</hi> Search them out, That is, as one that hath loſt a ſheep in Wilderneſs, he looks into this corner, and that quarter, and another quarter, and a fourth Corner, untill he hath ſearched it out. So when they deſign ſuch an Evill, they ſearch this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that affection; and this phancy, and that phancy, this thought, and that thought: untill they have ſearched out their iniquity, and this is the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of the heart: but how ſad a Wilderneſſe it is, who can declare? For <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors,</hi> that is bewildrings, which he ſpeaks of the Wilderneſs of his heart. For ſaith he) <hi>cleanſe thou mee from ſecret ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For further Evidence hereof,<note place="margin">Evidence hereof.</note> I ſhall look to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to Fooles, to your own Experience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Children (they ſay) ſpeak their hearts,<note place="margin">1. In Children.</note> and if ſo, I'm ſure, as ſoon as ever they begin to ſpeake, they ſpeak them to be a Wilderneſſe. Childrens words are as vain and fooliſh, and as inconſtant and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent as mens thoughts are. For Children ſpeak as Children. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. Men and women have as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thoughts, as Children have words: trace a Childs ſentences, and in two or three of them the Child will have quite loſt it ſelf, and doth not this ſpeak what a Wilderneſſe the heart of the Child is out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance whereof the mouth ſpeaks, yea, what a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thine (or mine) heart is by nature? Though thou canſt cover thine heart-bewildrings in more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115802:58"/> then the Child can do; yet God complains of men and women (as much as thou canſt note from Childrens moſt childiſh words) <hi>Jer,</hi> 4.14. <hi>How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee.</hi> Children ſpeak of one thing, and of another, and a third thing almoſt with one breath: and thou thinkſt of as many, almoſt with one glance of thine heart. Children talk, as thou thinkeſt, of impoſſibilities. Children put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of what they began with, by heaping up more new and vain words, and thou doſt the like, by multiplying new and vain thoughts. Is it not too true, when thou ſetteſt thy ſelf apart for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of thy ſouls eſtate before the Lord of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, of repentance from dead works? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh! how doe a thouſand thoughts come in, of one thing and another, and one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that thou art preſently at a loſſe, as to thy chief buſineſſe, and ſo thine own heart becomes thy Wilderneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Fooles. Theſe you ſay as well as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſpeak truth;<note place="margin">2. In fools and madmen.</note> and if you will believe it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, you muſt conclude their hearts to be no other then ſo many Wilderneſſes of confuſion. Have you not obſerved how madly mad men and women will expreſſe themſelves? Why? they do but write upon their own foreheads, what thou writeſt upon thine own heart, ſuch madneſſe is <hi>in the heart,</hi> (if it bee not in the mouth) <hi>of the Sons of men.</hi> Eccleſ. 9.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. In your own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>But thirdly, I will rather chooſe to convince the intelligent Chriſtian hereof from his own Expetience. Thou ſaiſt, thou wouldſt keep holy daies after an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and pray frequently, and perform all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtrictly: and why doſt thou not? Oh! ſaiſt thou, becauſe of the bewildring multitude of my vaine thoughts they come in, and lead me from one thing to another, from that to a third, from that to more,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115802:58"/> and by all from the buſineſſe in hand: and thus doth thine own heart prove a wildernes unto thee; ſomtimes bad thoughts, ſometimes good, but bad for thee; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good in themſelves, and good for thee too, (ſuch as thou mighteſt be glad of at another time) but bad for thee at this time, as carrying thee off from thy preſent duty. The Pſalmiſt complains, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 94.19.<note place="margin">An account or reaſons hereof.</note> 
                     <hi>of a multitude of thoughts within him.</hi> It ſeems, there are enough to bewilder, there are a multitude: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las ſhall I need to tell you ſo? I'm ſure you find it ſo. I ſhall therefore rather paſſe on to declare how it comes to be ſo. Take with you this threefold account. The exceeding bigneſſe, and vaſt latitude and Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the heart. The extream numerouſneſſe of the waies that are therein. The windings and turnings that are in thoſe waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt conſider the vaſt Dimenſion of the heart of man.<note place="margin">1. The vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the heart.</note> The World (as you have heard) is big enough for a Wilderneſſe, but the heart is much bigger. The world is not large enough to hold thine heart, but thine heart is big enough to hold a great many worlds. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> heart was too big for the world, for when he had conquered it he ſate down (ſom ſay) and wept, becauſe there were no more worlds for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He hath ſet the world in their heart.</hi> The World is nothing ſo big as the heart. I remember I once ſaw the pictures of our ſeverall faculties, as Will, Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one was the phancy of phancy, or the figure of the phantaſie; and O it was a painter painted, painting an heart, &amp; in that heart the world in one Corner (an harlot) the Emblem of the fleſh in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the Devill in the third: and I judge it live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed. The heart is ſo much bigger then the World, as to be able to hold the fleſh, that is, corrupt Nature, and the Devill too. Now put together our own Corruptions, all Satans temptations, and the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115802:59"/> World allurements, and if that heart that is big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to comprehend all theſe be not large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by theſe to become our Wildeerneſſe, judge you.</p>

Many waies that are in the heart.</note>SEcondly, Conſider the great many waies of this great heart, I'l warrant, enough to bewilder you. <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.21, <hi>There are many devices in the heart of man,</hi> and <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.9. <hi>A mans heart deviſeth his way.</hi> Put both together. There are many Devices of mans heart, and all theſe are the waies of mans heart; therefore <hi>many are the waiee of the heart of man.</hi> Like ſo great a City, that hath ſo many ſtreets, that one ſuppoſed to be bred and born in it, is not able to reckon, or to know them all, ſuch a City or Wilderneſſe rather is mans heart. To underſtand this, I would have you know, that all the waies of a mans life (that are properly mans waies) are firſt in mans heart. A mans heart deviſeth his way. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe heart are the waies of them,</hi> &amp;c. that is, of Gods people. Gods peoples waies are in their hearts: So <hi>ſinners waies</hi> are firſt of all of them in <hi>ſinners hearts:</hi> Hence I prove that their hearts are Wilderneſſes unto them. As if a man be to ride to <hi>London</hi> to morrow, the nature of the heart is to ride the journey before-hand to night; when it goes to ſleep, or in the morning when he wakes. So his heart ſins over his ſin before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. And how can theſe waies but be an heart-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs

                     <note place="margin">Evidences of the multitude of wayes in the heart.</note> The waies and counſels of their owne hearts were that which undid them, I ſhall farther offer two or three things under this head to your Conſideration, which may abundantly prove the multitude of the wayes of our heart, and readineſſe of thoſe wayes to bewilder us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There never was any way of ſin in any heart, but thine heart and mine are expoſe thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no tentation taken you, but that which is common to man,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>God will make a way to eſcape.</hi> Marke, Every temptation is a bewildring tentation, unleſſe God make a way, thou canſt not ſcape, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch temptation is common to man, even every one upon the Earth. The ſame temptation that undid <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to thee; and thy ſoule might be bewildred in the ſame wayes, if God made not a way to eſcape. Now thinke, what multitudes of waies are there for ſinners that live now to walke in, even all the wayes that ever ſinners walked in hitherto; therefore 'tis regiſtred of ſome afterward, that they <hi>went in the way of Cain (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them)</hi> Jud. 11. <hi>and followed the way of</hi> Balaam, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.

                  <p>Secondly, There was never way of ſinne in any heart, but thine heart and mine are naturally diſpoſed to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.19. <hi>As face in water anſwers face,</hi> ſo <hi>the heart of man anſwers to man.</hi> Thy face, in the water (which was then, I ſuppoſe, their onely looking-glaſſe) is not more like thy very face, then thine heart and anothers are by nature alike: the ſame diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115802:60"/> to cruelty, as in <hi>Cain;</hi> to covetouſneſſe, as in <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi> to betray Chriſt, as in <hi>Judas,</hi> or what ever elſe was comitted by whomſoever elſe you have heard of, or read of, or knowne, are naturally in thine owne heart. Thou art not onely ſubject and expoſed, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and diſpoſed unto them. And truly, I thinke it becomming us, when we heare of anothers ſinne in the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> to looke upon it as our owne in the <hi>Root,</hi> and ſo to be humbled for it, and rapt up in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his Grace, who hath made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There was never any ſinne in thine owne life, but it was the way of thine heart firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, &amp;c. They are all gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> verſe 3. ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Let not thine heart decline to her waies; go not aſtray in her paths.</hi> The heart goes alwaies before the reſt goes. Now then if all the waies of ſinne that ever thou wert in, or that ever any other were in, are and have been either actually, or as we ſay, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> in their originall, root and ſpawn, in thine heart, thou canſt not but reſt convicted, that there are in thine heart wayes enough to make a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3ly, The many windings of thoſe wayes.</note>Thirdly, As the heart of man is very great and full of waies ſo are thoſe waies full of windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to and againe; and therefore the heart cannot but be a Wilderneſſe. The heart of man is compared to the <hi>belly of a man,</hi> Prov. 20.27. becauſe of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a mans bowels (as Anatomiſts note) are fulleſt of windings: ſo full of windings are the wayes of the heart, ſo full I ſay, that himſelfe that walkes in them, can't know where he is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and who can know it?</hi> In the fifth verſe, you have mention of an heart, <hi>departing from the Lord,</hi> and therefore becomming an Heath in the <hi>Deſert,</hi> a <hi>ſalt Land,</hi> and <hi>a Wilderneſſe,</hi> verſe 6. And this is the heart that is ſo deſperately full of windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115802:60"/> verſe 9. When <hi>Peter</hi> thought that he was in the ſteadieſt way of profeſſion, his heart was winding into the way of apoſtacy.

                  <p>Firſt, You ſhall finde them ready to winde into any other way; yea, though it be the way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers duty, rather then to keepe in their owne way; that they connot indure, yea, to away of their owne duty at another time, rather then to keepe in the way that is now their way. Oh! thinkes the poore man, if If I were but rich, what would not I doe? If I were as the chiefe Governour, as the ſupream Power, ſay ſome hearts, oh! what would not I doe? Yea, but thou art what thou art: and tell me, doſt thou doe what is thy duty now to doe? 'Tis certaine (if otherwiſe) that thoſe are but the wilderneſſe-windings of thy crooked heart: thus <hi>Abſolon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 15.4. <hi>Oh! that I were made judge in the Land, I would doe every man right.</hi> If <hi>Abſolon</hi> were but King, he would be a Saint, but in the meane time never was there a more Deviliſh ſubject.

Oh! thinkeſt thou now, (if I were in ſecret) how ſweetly and brokenly could I powre out my ſoule, and perhaps in ſuch thoughts loſeſt thy ſelfe, and ſome part of the Sermon: perhaps by that time thou art come at home and in a corner, thy heart is wound off againe from that frame; and now, oh! that thou wert a hearing againe to warme thee: to this purpoſe ſee farther, how miſtaken duty is a meanes to bewilder us, whereunto ſomewhat is to be ſpoken more largely in

I ſhall mind you but of one inſtance for proofe of the truth, whereof I ſhall appeale to the experience of thoſe that know what it is to keepe watch over their own hearts: (and if it be ſo with the people of God, how much more with the unregenerate?) And 'tis this; the gracious ſpirit being put (through tentation, or naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) upon ſome piece of pride; It goes ſolicitouſly to the Throne of grace, that God would break its pride of ſpirit, and give it a lowly, broken, tender, humble heart. And in its exceedingly earneſt ſupplications and Agonies of ſoule, God comes in exceedingly: the heart is hereby much broken, the Spirit exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled and abaſed, and laid very low. Now watch for theſe windings of heart that I ſpeake of: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115802:62"/> you may too ſoon ſpie them out. The poor heart begins to looke upon it ſelf under theſe enlargements, and to like it ſelfe, to reflect upon its broken-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humility, and to be pleaſed in them, and with them; yea, verily, in plaine engliſh, <hi>to grow proud of its very humility:</hi> and this, as I ſaid, is to wind quite round: Now as ſoon as ever it becomes thus wound aſide, you may know its in a Wilderneſſe by the thorns it ſhall meet with, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Thornes in the fleſh,</hi> there muſt and will be, when the heart winds about to this pride in the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then if the heart be ſo capacious, and ſo full of wayes, and thoſe waies ſo full of windings, you cannot but conclude, how eaſily the heart, nay, how neceſſarily it becomes a <hi>Wilderneſſe.</hi> Thine heart is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> yea, and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> too to all the wayes and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſpirit that ever entangled any ſoule in the world, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Our hearts prevalent in tempting us upon two grounds.</note> If the bent of our hearts be Wilderneſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it's eaſie to conceive how they bend us towards the Wilderneſſe. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>they ſet their heart on thoir iniquity, and I will puniſh them for their waies.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Their waies are according to the bent of their hearts.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Led away with divers luſts.</hi> Luſts thoſe are the ſtirrings and motions of the heart, and theſe are the tempters to lead us away.

And that upon theſe two grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our hearts are the men of our Counſell.<note place="margin">1. They are our Boſome-Counſellors.</note> They lie in our boſoms, and therefore, as to the choice of all our waies, with them it is that we conſult. Our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom-friends and darling relations are our hearts. If man be refractory, as to any way; It's policy to perſwade the wife of his boſom; prevail with her, and 'tis likely ſhe will prevail with him. Satan when hee would ſeduce us into any of his waies, hee firſt makes it his buſineſſe to overcome our hearts in our boſoms, and us by them. Pray thee husband go ſaith the wife, and then he goes. Pray go ſaith the heart, and away he goes. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Adam was not deceived</hi> (that is, not firſt) <hi>but the woman being deceived was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Two things there are here remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the woman that lay in <hi>Adams</hi> boſom was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred (for ſo the word ſignifies) before the man.</p>
                  <pb n="011" facs="tcp:115802:64"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the heart of the woman was bewildred, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>) was led to go aſtray. The woman in <hi>Adams</hi> boſom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred him; the heart in <hi>Eves</hi> boſom bewildred her. The influence of the wife of thy boſom to perſwade thee, is grounded upon propriety. Shee being thine own ſo nearly, ſo dearly, thou think'ſt ſhe will not perſwade thee, but to thine own good: and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that thine heart hath upon thee to guide thy bent after its own bent, and thy waies after its own waies, is the propriety that thou haſt in it, and it in thee, thus <hi>Jam</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is tempted, when he is lead away of his own luſt.</hi> That which tempts him, leads him, and that which leades him, <hi>leads him away,</hi> and that which thus tempts him and leads him away is luſt, and the reaſon why luſt hath ſuch prevalency upon him is, becauſe it is his own luſt. So then 'tis his own heart that leads him to the Wilderneſſe of his own ruine.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2d.

Now what ſaith thine heart? what way it votes, that way thou goeſt. <hi>Come now;</hi> is Gods voice: <hi>Not yet,</hi> ſaith Satan: <hi>Not yet,</hi> ſaith the heart, why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then thou ſtayeſt in the Wilderneſſe ſtill. You have often mention of Gods voice to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet little good was wrought by it: Why what hindred? oh! their hearts voice was the third voice, and that was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-vote to Gods. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I ſaid, Obey my voice, and walk in my waies.</hi> Gods voice is, walk in Gods waies: <hi>But they hearkned not.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>But walked in the

                     <hi>The Dragon and his Angells;</hi> who can number them? if they doe but ſtand round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a poore unregenerate Creature, who can but be bewildred by them?

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans numbers are ſo great, that he can even ſpare 6000 Devils to bewilder one poore ſoule. Now thinke with your ſelves: if there be ſix thouſand Counſellors about a man, one ſaith, goe this way, another ſaith, goe that way; a third, another way, a tenth, a tenth way, an hundreth, an hundreth way, &amp;c. The proud Devil cryes, goe my way: the drunken Devill, go my way: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Devill, go my way: the blaſpheming Devill, goe my way: the prophane Devill, goe my way; the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Devill, go my way: the transformed Devill, or the Devill turned into an Angell of light, goe my way: The mad-merry frolick Devill, goe my way: and the melancholick deſpairing Devill, go my way: how can it be but that a poore ſoule muſt needs be bewildred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115802:66"/> all theſe, and five hundred times as many more? for I have reckon'd but twice ſix unto you. When ſix thouſand tempters and temptations ſhal at once environ one ſingle ſpirit, as <hi>Legion</hi> did here this poore man; can you wonder if as you read of this man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.29. <hi>That he was driven into the Wilderneſſe;</hi> ſo you finde it true of your owne ſoules, that they are ſo often bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. I obſerve that in ſome caſes, Satan doth as the great Turk, that bears down all meerly with the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſſe of his Armies. When poore ſoules ſhall think with themſelves to be ſerious with God, and to go indeed about the buſineſs of Converſion: oh! what ſwarms of Devills, what multitudes of temptations be there, even to the tyring out of ſuch thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions! Oh! how doe theſe Legions bewilder us both in prayer and meditations, and indeed in every ſpirituall Undertaking. It were eaſie for Satan at even hand to conquer us, no wonder then if he lead us cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive even whither ſoever he will, being ſix thouſand to one, that's great odds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2d. Head. His agreement unity, and concord.</note> Great is Satans advantage as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildring of your ſoules, becauſe of the accord and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that is amongſt them all. So the ſoule be but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred, they care not which of them doth it; and indeed whoever of them prevailes to ſeduce, meets all the reſt of them in the Wilderneſſe. As now there are millions of waies in <hi>England,</hi> a way likely in every paſture, and that foot-path leads to ſome lane, that lane to ſome Market-town Road, and that Road in time to <hi>London</hi>-Road, till at length all will meet at <hi>London:</hi> ſo amongſt the millions of temptations and legions of tempters, the ſmaller temptations lead into greater wayes, and thoſe into greater, till at length all runne together into the broad way of the wilderneſſe of ſinne, for all of them conſpire to meet one another there. There is a marvellous ſtrange concord amongſt whole legions of Devills (Oh! that there were no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115802:67"/> breaches to be ſeen amongſt the thouſands of Gods Saints. You may obſerve, that though this man were poſſeſſed with many, even with a Legion; yet Chriſt calls them all but <hi>an uncleane ſpirit,</hi> Luk. 8.29. ver. 27. He had Devills, verſe 30. a Legion, even many Devills were entred into him, yet verſe 29. Jeſus <hi>commanded the unclean ſpirit:</hi> ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 5.8. <hi>He ſaid, Come out of the man, thou unclean ſpirit.</hi> And all the Devils beſought him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and forthwith the <hi>unclean ſpirits went out,</hi> verſe 14. I obſerve that the Devils be they never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, agree all of them as one. Hence it is, that you heare but of Satan and the Devill in the ſingular, when wee meane all thoſe numberleſſe numbers of uncleane hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, tempting, damned ſpirits. And what is it now, that they are thus agreed upon, or accord better in, then in tempting of ſouls into this wilderneſſe? He was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a whole Legion: 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.29. <hi>He was driven of the Devill into the Wilderneſſe.</hi> It ſeems they all agreed in this, as one Devill to lead him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now who can imagine, but it is rather Satans buſineſſe to lead a ſpiritually poſſeſſed ſoule into this ſpirituall wilderneſſe, then to take ſo much paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch a poore Gadaren, to drive him into dry and deſart places? Whatſoever may be the literall import of this ſcripture, ſure I am, that the Devills in our dayes deſigne, and accord an hundred fold more in the bewildring of poore ſoules, by their legion of temptations, then to lead them into deſolate and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſart places.</p>

But now becauſe Satan is a Spirit, therefore he is the better able to eneer into the ſoule: the nearer related he is to the ſoule, the more able is he to argue out the buſineſſe with the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Satan being a ſpirit,<note place="margin">1. He is able to enter into the ſoule.</note> is eaſily able to enter the ſoule. When a Generall beſieges a City, though he caſt a trench about it, yet every one within it doth move in his own motion, and goe his owne waies for all him, or any of his commands, while he is without: but now if once he enter the City, then they muſt goe whither ſoever he drives them, ſome to Priſon, ſome into the Water, others to the Gallowes, others into the Wilderneſſe: ſo though there be legions of Devils without us, yet till they enter us, our hearts may keepe their own motions; yea, though they be round about us: but you'l ſay, <hi>They muſt needs go whom the Devill drives;</hi> though it be into Water, as the <hi>herd of ſwine;</hi> into the halter, as <hi>Judas;</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, as <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and the Devill may eaſily drive when he enters, and indeed may eaſily enter, becauſe hee is a Spirit. Sirs, What can poſſibly keep out a Spirit? ſhut downe your Windowes, lock your doores, yea though your Gates were Iron, and your Barres of Braſſe, yet will a Spirit enter, and that without penetration, becauſe its not a body. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. That <hi>Satan</hi> then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>into Judas.</hi> From henceforward trace him; and where ever he goes, you may plainly ſee the Devill drives him. It followes immediately, verſe 4. <hi>And he went his way.</hi> He goes Chriſts wayes no longer, but his owne, and his owne are but Satans; for firſt he goes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115802:68"/> and <hi>betrayes his Maſter,</hi> and then he goes and hangs <hi>himſelfe.</hi> He muſt needs goe, the Devill drives him. Drunkards, you little thinke who drives you to the Alehouſe, he that drives you, is got within you, and therefore though you cannot ſee him, yet you goe with him whitherſoever he would have you to goe: ſo it is with all ſinners. Satan's a Spirit, and therefore he can enter: he enters, and therefore he can drive: hee can drive, and you muſt therefore needs go, and hence you are <hi>driven of the Devill into the Wilderneſs,</hi> as hee was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2ly, He (as a Spirit) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinne to the ſoule.</note>2ly, Satan is a Spirit, and therefore he is (as it were) akinne to the ſoule: You know the proverb concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Birds, and I may ſay in ſome ſort, Satan is of a feather with our ſoules, and one wing one way. Hence it is that when our ſoules ſee Satan goe before, we are ſo mad of fluttering aftrr. Beloved, Satans ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo alike our owne hearts motions, that wee ſometimes ſhall finde it very hard to know his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps from our owne. Now marke, If a man be in a Wilderneſſe, and there be never ſo many tracts of this, and that, and th'other wild beaſt, if the man light upon a print but of one mans foot, oh! that's the way that he will be ſure to take; and Satans footſteps are ſo like ours, that who can ſometimes know the print aſunder? You have <hi>Peter</hi> diſſwading Chriſt from ſuffering, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.22. And 'tis ſaid, <hi>Peter began to rebuke him;</hi> and I verily thinke, that <hi>Peter</hi> thought it it was his owne way, and an expreſſion of his owne hearts love to Jeſus Chriſt: and I believe the other Diſciples thought it was a print of <hi>Peters</hi> feet, of <hi>Peters</hi> tender affections to his Lord and Maſter: But it ſeemes it was not ſo, or primarily ſo: 'twas Satans footſtep rather then <hi>Peters,</hi> for Jeſus turn'd him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> verſe 23. We are often going <hi>Satans way,</hi> when we think we are going but our <hi>own way.</hi> Therefore with eaſe may <hi>Satan</hi> lead you into the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115802:68"/> wildernes, when wee may ſo eaſily perſwade you that is your own way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Satan is a ſpirit,<note place="margin">3. He (as a ſpirit) is able to converſe &amp; reaſon with the ſoul.</note> and therefore able to Converſe with the ſoul, as to look our ſpirits (as I may ſay) in the face in their own likeneſſe, ſo alſo to ſpeak to them in their own language. As <hi>Hannah</hi> ſpake with her heart, when ſhee ſpake not with her lips, ſo can Satan ſpeak to our hearts, and they to him without any opening of the lips, for both are ſpirits. As are wee, ſo Satan is a diſcurſive rationall ſpirit; and as at firſt he diſputed out the buſineſſe with <hi>Eve,</hi> and prevailed, ſo ever ſince in the ſerpents voice, though not in the ſerpent skin, hee maintaines a like argument in our ſoules; and this hee can do becauſe a ſpirit. You ſhall therefore finde that the ſame that is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11. the bewildrings of Satan, is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>the devices</hi> of Satan; ſo we read it, but the word is that which ſignifies the reaſonings and arguings of our hearts. So then Satan ſeduceth us into the Wilderneſſe, by preſſing upon us our own arguments, he perſwades us by our own <hi>logick,</hi> in the naturall language of our own hearts. A Lyon may roar long enough, before a man that is without the Forreſt, and hears him, would come in to him: But if inſtead of a Lyon, a man were there calling, and ſo the other ſhould hear one crying in his owne voice and language, that might perhaps perſwade him. It were vain for Satan to roar men into ſin, though hee be a roaring Lion: but he muſt flatter them into it by ſecret whiſperings, in their own language, to their ſoules. If the Devill ſhould appear and ſpeak to the drunkard in the morning, in a dog or a toad, as he doth to ſome witches, ſure the Drunkard would be affrighted for that day. But he ſpeaks in the mans own hearts language: <hi>Go to ſuch a place, there's ſuch company, and ſuch ber,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore that Scripture
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115802:69"/> is ſadly to be thought up. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Their heart goes after the heart of their dete ſtable things, and of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</hi> Here's one heart going after another: the heart of the tempted after the heart of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our hearts in ſinning, going after Satans heart in tempting. He projects and we proſecute; his heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and our heart purſues the deſigne. The tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan are deſtable, yet they are after his heart, and our heart goes after the heart of the deteſtable things, that is, after Satans heart; you ſee the ſame word that ſignifies our Cogitations, the Holy Ghoſt uſeth for Satans devices: and this is becauſe hee is a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As he is a Spirit, ſo he is an Angell, and this gives him yet far greater advantage:<note place="margin">2dly, He is an Angel, and therefore can preſent all his temptations ſpecious and angelicall.</note> God tells them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. that he would ſend his Angell before them, and that encourages them to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Wilderneſſe. So Satan ſends his Angell before poor ſouls, and ſo gets them into this ſpirituall Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe. He is an Angell, and therefore all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhall be guilded temptations; beautified with Angells feathers. Though he be a Devill, yet his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions to the ſoul, ſhall be as an Angell, even as an Angell of light. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. 'Tis ſaid of ſome that <hi>they draw iniquity with Cords of Vanity, and ſin as it were with Cart-ropes.</hi> Iſa. 5.18. and what are theſe drawing Cords? <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>they call evill good, and put light for darkneſſe, and ſweet for bitter;</hi> and whence is this? but becauſe the Devill can appear as an Angell; the firſt view of temptation is as Paradiſe, the laſt view or end thereof as Hell. The young man is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Pro.</hi> 7. with a deckt bed, <hi>Coverings of Tapeſtry, carved works, fine linnen of Aegypt, perfumes of Mirrhe Aloes and Cinamon: fill of love, ſolaces with loves.</hi> ver. 16, 17, 18. Fair words and ſhewes, but flattering. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and he goes after theſe, but 'tis <hi>like an Ox to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115802:69"/> the ſlaughter, or a fool to the Correction of the ſtocks.</hi> This then is Satans leading-influence, his temptations though as Hell, as Devills, ſeem as faire as Angells. Therefore I may ſay of Satan, <hi>though he ſpeak thee fair, believe him not:</hi> for <hi>there are ſeven abomination in his heart.</hi> as Pro. 26.25.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As he is a Spirit, and an Angell,<note place="margin">3dly, He is a Devil, and ſo cares not what meanes he uſeth.</note> ſo is hee a Devill, and therefore hath yet the more advantage. A Devill; therefore he cares not what means he uſeth to bewilder ſoules. A Miniſter muſt not lie for God, he muſt not vent a lie to ſave a ſoul; But Satan will tell a thouſand to undoe a ſoul. Yea, he had as live damne them with ſpeaking falſe as true, he is a Devill, and therefore cares not what way he goes. <hi>One of you ſhall betray me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) One of us, Lord? might they ſay, who could find in his heart to do ſo? who could dare to doe ſo? why? ſaith Chriſt, <hi>One of you is a Devill.</hi> He can do any thing, he is a Devill. A Devill cares not what he ſaith, nor what he ſwears, in order to the ruine of a poor ſool. An high-way man cares not, though he ſwear you, or lye you, into a wrong way; telling you its right, that there he may have opportunity to rob you. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. When he (that is the Devill) <hi>ſpeaketh a lie,</hi> hee <hi>ſpeaketh it of his own, for he is a lyer, and a Father of it: and that becauſe he is a Devill.</hi>

                  <p>FOurthly, The Relations that Satan ſtands in,<note place="margin">4. Head. His relations.</note> to the men of the World do greatly advantage him as to their bewildring? what was't (think you) that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115802:70"/> perſwaded the little Ones amongſt the Iſraelites to adventure into that Wilderneſſe? ſure it was, becauſe their Relations went; Their parents went, and what made their Parents go? why? becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> their Prince and leader went; and what was't that made <hi>Moſes</hi> go? becauſe God had told him that he would be with him, and go before him, as you may clearly obſerve in that ſtory. And verily one great advantage that Satan hath to bewilder ſoules, is the relations that he ſtands in to unregenerate ſouls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. He is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the World: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followed readily.</note>Firſt, Satan is in relation of a Father to them. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you ſhould chuſe to live in a deſert, doe you think your Children would not be willing to bear you Company? to do as you doe, and be where you are? ſurely moſt Children would. You would follow a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even into a Forreſt, though it were a place of danger; you would bee loath your Father ſhould goe alone. Naturall relation teaches in ſuch a Caſe, to ſay as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi, Ruth</hi> 1.16. <hi>Whither thou goeſt, I will go, and where thou lodgeſt I will lodge.</hi> And ſuch indeed is the language of our hearts to Satan, who as we are unregenerate, ſtands related as a father, to us. The very reaſon why men doe his workes, and walk in his waies, Our Saviour gives, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.44. <hi>You are of your Father the Deuill, and his workes you will do.</hi> They do them, and they will do them, and what's the reaſon? they are of their Father. The young mans Father in the Goſpell <hi>bids him go into his Vineyard,</hi> and he cryes <hi>I go ſir.</hi> Satan your Father bids you drink and rail, and curſe, and revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Lord knowes, you goe, ſirs, at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. He is a Prince to the world.</note>2ly, Satan ſtands related to them as their Prince, therefore they'l follow him into the Wilderneſſe. What hath beene the common voice of theſe times? What ſhall not I go after my King? ſhall not I follow my Prince? yea, that they would, though into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115802:70"/> You have mention of <hi>thouſands of murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Wilderneſſe.</hi> Acts 21.38. and whence was it? oh? oh! their leader that Egyptian went before them thither. So in ſpiritualls. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, <hi>You were dead in treſpaſſes</hi> (that is, in your goings out of the way) <hi>Wherein in times paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world</hi> (and what followes?) <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prince of the power of the air,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit that now rules in the Children of diſobedience: among whom we alſo had our Converſation in times paſt.</hi> &amp;c. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we all walk in this Courſe (that is, race or way) as long as we ſtand in relation to, and are under the power of this Prince.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. He is the God of the World.</note> Satan ſtands related as a God unto them. What gracious heart would not willingly follow God, though he ſhould lead them into a Wilderneſſe of affliction, and ſurely Satan being their God, they are ſoone perſwaded to follow him into this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin; you have mention made of ſome that are loſt ſpiritually. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it's hid to them that are loſt.</hi> If the light be hid, or the guidance be in vain, it is to thoſe that are loſt, yea, but how came they to be loſt? <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded their Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. He is their God, hence it is that they are loſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider Satans Experience:<note place="margin">5. Head. His experience. He hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred all meerly men, therefore hee may eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder thee.</note> it gives him great advantage to bewilder thee: Oh Satan is ſo old a ſerpent, that he knowes all the turnings of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; and he can ſoon tell when hee doth but ſee thee, which of them all will beſt ſuit with thee. It is not ſtrange Satan ſhould bewilder thee, that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred ſo many thouſands before thee.</p>
                  <p>There never was a meere man, but Satan both led him into the Wilderneſſe, and loſt him there. Avoid <hi>her waies</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> of the tempting harlot) <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.25. <hi>go not aſtray in her paths, for ſhe hath caſt down many wonded, yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115802:71"/> her,</hi> ver. 26. Take heed of comming near this Lyons Den, for he hath drawn as many, as ever paſs'd by, into it. And doſt thou thinke amongſt all the ſoules that Satan hath bewildred in former ages, there hath not been ſome one juſt of thy complexion and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? if there have beene, then as a laſt made for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet if it be of the ſame ſize with thy foot, it will fit thy foot: So the ſame temptation, the ſame way wil ſerve to wilder thee. <hi>David</hi> was a ruddy man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and the Devill knew by a look of him, what path of the Wilderneſſe would entangle him. The Devill hath bewildred paſſionate folks before, and proud folks before, and luſtfull ones before, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ones before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it cannot be but (what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the length of thy foot is) that Satan by this time ſhould have a way in the Wilderneſſe fitted for thee. (As an old cheat that will have more tricks then one, that if one fail, another may take, and that the young fool might not know all. So Satan, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.6. <hi>leſt thou ſhouldſt ponder the path of life, his waies are moveable, ſo that thou canſt not know them.</hi>) And this is his great advantage; It may be thou art a young Chriſtian, a young Saint, but thou haſt to doe with an Old Serpent.</p>

                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119 9. My friends, as you would tremble at the thoughts of following Satan as your King, and God, and Father, in his way, bee very carefull in the choice of your own waies. I have obſerved that careleſneſſe of our waies is the adding of advantage to Satan, to all his advantages, and 'tis as if you ſhould ſay, <hi>Satan hath not enough already, Ile give him more.</hi> How many are there that goe on and on, and never conſider in what way or to what end? He that goes and conſiders not whither, is like to be loſt he knowes not where. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. God calls <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael a back-ſliding people.</hi> It followes, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed</hi> (or gone out of the way) and <hi>and haſt ſcattered thy waies to ſtrangers.</hi> Mark that Thoſe that are inconſiderate and heedleſſe of what things they have, are they that ſcatter them. Here's a ſcattering of waies to this ſtrange temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that ſtrange luſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now what is the way to keep from ſcattering, but by narrow looking to that which otherwiſe we ſhould ſcatter? As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaid I will take heed unto my waies!</hi> Pſal. 39.1. Thoſe then that are heedleſſe of their waies, are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of their waies: and know it, ſirs, whatever waies you ſcatter, Satan will be ſure to gather. Scatter a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon out of your memories, and theſe fowls of the aire will pick it up, and carry it away. Scatter but a thought or any affection on a carnal or ſinfull object, the Devill will ſnatch it up and carry it away. This then is the deſperate folly of our hearts, that by heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe wee ſhould ſcatter our waies to ſtrangers. Therefore ſaith the ſame Prophet to the ſame People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. thus <hi>ſaith the Lord, ſtand ye in the waies, and ſee and ask.</hi> &amp;c. Surely many a man's bewlldred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when time was, he did not ſtand and ask. Oh that I could bring but ſinners to a ſtand this day! whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away ſo faſt, thou galloping drunkard, &amp; ranting roiſter? What, wilt not once ſtop before thou lighteſt

Pauſe a little, and aske and ſee: Perhaps there may be nere another houſe betwixt thee and the Wilderneſſe to inquire at: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou maiſt never heare a Sermon more, or be at a publique meeting more, and therefore whileſt thou paſſeſt by the doore of this dayes diſcourſe, ſtand a while, and aske and ſee. What madneſſe is it to runne prepoſterouſly into any way, when a ſober inquiry might find a <hi>right?</hi> I am confident this is the undoing of many a ſoule, they are never brought to a ſtand, till Hell ſtops them. But let us take Gods counſell to day in Gods feare, to <hi>ſtand and ask, and ſee and chooſe.</hi> Two Expreſſions of <hi>David</hi> laid together, may engage Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hereunto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, I have ſtuck unto thy teſtimonies,</hi> verſe 31.

If a Father ſend his Sonne ſuch a dangerous journey, where there are many upon the Way, whoſe buſineſſe it is to turne the traveller aſide, that they might in a Corner make a

At ſuch a place you muſt turne on the left hand of ſuch a ſteeple, and when you goe farther, you muſt turne on the right hand of ſuch a Wind-mill, &amp;c. Now when he comes to ſuch a place, and ſees ſuch a ſteeeple, he perceiveth the marks to be true markes: a Robber enters diſcourſe with him, enquires his way, tells him his way lies right with his, they come neare the ſteeple or windmill, &amp;c. The Robber tells him, he muſt turn one way, he lookes on his Note, and that ſaith he muſt turne another; upon this he ſeaſonably and ſecurely parts, and avoids the danger by due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his Way-marks.

Keepe your Markes, or loſe your way. God hath (bleſſed be his name!) ſet down in a Paper, which way we ſhould goe, and what way we ſhould turne from, both upon the right hand, and upon the left. And this uſe of the Scriptures is preſidented to us by Chriſt himſelf the onely begotten Sonne of God. Satan leads him to the Wilderneſſe, with deſigne (could it have been) to bewilder him there: He would turne him as you heard before, into many wayes, preſumption, ſelf-murder, &amp;c. but Chriſt, though he knew of himſelfe the evill from the good, yet (to direct us too, and to credit the uſe of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures herein) He looks upon his writing, and turnes off all upon that account.

                  <p>What are the meanes of the bewildring of ſoules? Surely all the meanes that can be uſed ſhall be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Satan hereunto: He that will take all paines, as you have heard of Satan in the laſt, will alſo uſe all means that may be conducible to his end. I remember <hi>Pauls</hi> ardent care for the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115802:79"/> for <hi>this cauſe when I could no longer forbear, I ſent to know your faith, leſt by any means</hi> (as the originall well bears) <hi>the tempter may have tempted you.</hi> Satan will make uſe of any means whatſoever unto the bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of poor ſouls. Friends you muſt therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, if we exhort ſeriouſly, and adviſe ſollicitouſly, and reprove cuttingly and ſharply, if wee cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear doing ſo, you muſt bear with us, for wee are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated (as <hi>Paul</hi> here) hereunto, becauſe <hi>by any means the tempter will be tempting you.</hi> Satan will make uſe of means, of any means, of all means: now all the means (obſerve) that he uſeth as a tempter, he uſeth to bewilder ſoules. Compare that ſcripture with the fore quoted. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. (You know Satan made uſe of any means, lying means, flattering meanes, deluding means to tempt <hi>Eve,</hi> and this text expreſſeth it (as you heard) thus, ſhe being <hi>led out of the way, went out of the way.</hi> So that Satans <hi>tempting meanes</hi> are all of them <hi>bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring means.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Before I come to particulars, I ſhall mind you of two things more generally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Satan in this multitude hath choice or change of paths.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath trimme or pleaſant paths, and both theſe are great means to bewilder ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">1. Satan hath change of paths.</note> In the multitude of paths Satan hath change for thee. If thou be weary of drinking, he hath a whore for thee: if thou be weary of prophaneſs down-right, he hath formality for thee. And ſo as thou moveſt thine inclination, Satan can move thy way. If thou changeſt thy mind, Satan can change thy path. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.6. leſt <hi>thou ſhouldſt ponder the path of life, her waies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115802:80"/> are moveable.</hi> And, <hi>why gaddeſt thou about to change thy way, ſaith God.</hi> Jer. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 36.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. Hee hath trim waies.</note>2ly, In the multitude of waies, Satan wants not trim waies, even ſuch as you may be taken and enamoured with.</p>
                  <p>It may be, before Satan, was carrying thee to Hell, in the way of drunkenneſſe, now in the way of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or ſobriety; this is a trimmer way then the other; yet this without grace is but a Wilderneſſe-way ſtill. It may be before thou waſt going curſing or ſwearing to Hell; but now (being legally convicted and wrought upon) it may be, thou art going faſting and praying with the Phariſee to Hell. Why? this is a trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way then the other, yet but a bewildring way ſtill. We may ſay to Satan, as God ſaith to his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which skill doubtleſſe they derive from him their Maſter. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.33. <hi>Why trimmeſt thou thy waies to ſeek love? therefore haſt thou taught wicked ones thy paths.</hi> What's the reaſon Satan hath ſo many ſcholers to learn his paths? Oh! 'tis becauſe he doth ſo trimme ſome of his waies to ſeek love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Particularly.</note>But more particularly theſe are theſe various and trimme waies, which Satan uſually bewilders ſoules by.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">The way of carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</note>1. The waies of Carnall and ſinfull pleaſure. If theſe will but bewilder them, he will never go farther. <hi>I have deckt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have perfumed my bed.</hi> Pro. 7.16, 17. <hi>Come let us take our fill of love till the morning.</hi> As long as the ſeaſon of the pleaſures of ſin laſt, if thoſe waies will bewilder them, Satan will give them their very fill. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>We had among them in times paſt, our Converſation, fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind,</hi> &amp;c. and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. he ſaith <hi>put off, concerning the former converſation,</hi> (or waies) <hi>the old man, which is corrupt according to deceitfull luſts.</hi> The reaſon why ſo few walk in Gods
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115802:80"/> wayes, and ſo many in Satans Wilderneſſe, is becauſe Satan lets them, lets them walk in wayes gratifying, to fulfill their own luſts.</p>

The poore man thinkes his way a right way: <hi>Every way of man is right in his own eyes,</hi> Prov. 21.2. Yea, though the <hi>end thereof be as the waies of death,</hi> Prov. 16.25. He walkes thoſe paths, where he treads on Serpents every day, yet feareth not, for hee goeth after Satan ſtreight-way, as a <hi>Bird that haſteth to the ſnare,</hi> and <hi>knoweth not</hi> (marke that) <hi>that it is for its life,</hi> Prov. 7.23. Oh! if you drunkards and ſwearers, and proud perſons, and hypocrites, did but know what Satan is leading, and you following him for, in the faireſt and moſt verdant paths of the Wilderneſſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, believe it, you would ſay now, as you will do when the <hi>evill dayes come, I have no pleaſure in them;</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly,<note place="margin">3ly, The way of Civility.</note> But when Convictions of Conſcience come to unmask, and to unvizard carnall ſecurity, and to wipe off the paint and verdure of ſinfull delights. Now Satan muſt change and move his way, and ſo he doth. And now for <hi>Civility.</hi> Oh! the man leaves off ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ranting, &amp;c. and now thinks he, this is a good way indeed: truly this in it ſelfe is a better way then the other; but yet the wayes of Civility, and mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, may be but bewildring wayes to the ſoule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>Here's a civill lovely young man,</hi> as to Moralities he had kept all the Commadements <hi>from his youth,</hi> verſe 20. Yet other temptations were to him a Wilderneſſe, <hi>and he goeth ſorrowful away from Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> verſe 22. And truly, as you may ſee in this young man, theſe civill paths of the Wilderneſs, are in ſome reſpect moſt dangerous, becauſe moſt faire and ready to ſilence the grudgings of naturall Conſcience. What will he ſay, have I thought my ſelfe a good man thus many yeare?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115802:81"/> and have all my neighbours thought me ſo too? and ſhall I now thinke that all is nothing worth, becauſe you undervalue Civilities; or for want of a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe and godlineſſe? ſure it is a very hard matter to perſwade a meer civilized perſon to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>

                     <note place="margin">4ly, The way of Duties.</note>4ly, But when Convictions are deeper, and the view of the ſtrait-Rule of Gods command, makes him ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the crookedneſſe of his Moralities, and their maimedneſſe without Godlineſſe. Now Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can permit him to faſt and pray, and that often too, and yet, in this way, bewilder him. Thus the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Luk. 18.11, 12. He got often into the way of Duty, and religious Exerciſe, but never into the <hi>way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> verſe 14.

                  <p n="6">6ly, It may be Convictions grow ſo much higher, yet that God ſheweth thee, as he did them, how little worth is in thy very humblings: and then it may bee thy way is to looke out for a Saviour, for anothers
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115802:82"/> performances and worth to leane upon. Now this is Satans laſt remove, if hee can but make thee to mingle thy worth with Chriſts, and thy workes with Chriſts workes, and ſo to walke in a middle way (for ſuch a way there is) betwixt Faith and Workes, Satan will not ſo much diſturbe himſelfe, for thou art in a loſt condition ſtill; for this is the High-way of Goſpel-ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to ſet thy <hi>feet in the way,</hi> but not to reſt thy ſoul upon <hi>the way of doing;</hi> but to ſet downe thine Hope as thy ſtaffe, ſoftly, and ſingly upon the way of believing, I will not deny, but that <hi>in performing</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) thou maiſt expect <hi>reward;</hi> but if thou lookeſt for thy reward for thy <hi>performances,</hi> thou loſeſt it, and thy ſelfe for ever. You read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.2. of an <hi>Angell</hi> that ſet <hi>his right foot upon the Sea,</hi> and <hi>his left foot upon the Earth.</hi> And ſo truly doe many men, the beſt (and yet the worſt in ſome ſome ſort) of the unregenerate, they ſet one foot, and it may be the right foot (I do but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the place) upon the <hi>Red Sea of Chriſts blood;</hi> but then they will have one foot, the left at leaſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth of their owne Righteouſneſſe, but theſe things ought not ſo to be. Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe, <hi>Our Workes,</hi> ſay they; <hi>merit, dipt in Chriſts blood.</hi> And oh! what naturall Doctrine is this to fleſh and blood? How eaſily are we made <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Whence is it, to give you one hint, that a poore ſoule when enlarged in prayer, though (perhaps) it have acted little faith in ſuch a prayer, can pleaſe and pride it ſelfe ſo much, when at another time it hath looked as much, and more at Chriſt, and leſſe a great deale at <hi>ſelfe;</hi> and yet becauſe it hath been ſtraightned, hath it thought, it ſhould not be ſo well accepted at the Throne of Grace. Doe wee not thank our ſelves, as well as Chriſt, for our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; as he that thanked his Tumbrel, as much as God for his Harveſt. Now this, though it be the laſt and trimmeſt way of all the reſt, yet is it extreamely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for there is no comming out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115802:82"/> but onely by leaning, and by leaning only upon Jeſus Chriſt, as our Text it ſelfe, and farther Diſcourſe, may give you to know. 'Tis not the way of Carnall pleaſures or ſecurity: 'tis not the way of Civilities or Duties either: 'tis not the way of being humbled, 'tis not a mixt way betweene working and believing; that is, betwixt thy Workes and Chriſts, (though thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings muſt be) but the way of pure believing, that can lead thee out of ſinnes Wilderneſſe. The other may be trim wayes, but this is the onely true way.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115802:85"/> reaſon, I believe that people generally continue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred, is Miniſters preaching ſo much in a generall way to particular ſoules in their naturall condition, that do not uſe to take home any more to themſelves then we carry home into their boſoms, whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they will or no. Surely as it is not food in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that ſupports, or Phyſick in generall that heales the body, ſo is it not the truth in general that cures the ſoul, but this or that food, or Phyſick applyed to this or that body, or this or that truth applyed to this or that ſoul.

And truly the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a generall-preaching Miniſter is little more worth, then the Counſell of a Country-Ideot, that when a travailer ſhould ask the way to <hi>London,</hi> hee ſhould anſwer <hi>London-Road:</hi> and the man ſhould reply, yea, but which is <hi>London-Road,</hi> or which way ſhall I take to get into it? and he ſhould anſwer nay, <hi>I cannot tell.</hi> So they preach that ſin is the <hi>way to Hel,</hi> and <hi>Repentance and Faith</hi> are the <hi>way to Heaven;</hi> yea, but ſaith a poor ſoule which hears them preach thus generally, yea, but <hi>what is Faith,</hi> or <hi>Repentance?</hi> or <hi>how ſhal we do to know whether I repent, or believe, or no?</hi> What is it to <hi>mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> and what is it to <hi>walk after the ſpirit</hi> (which you ſay we muſt do?) and truly the Miniſter is come the next time to a new Text; and never unties the old knot. And ſo the poor ſoul is as much at a loſſe as ever it was; Onely it knowes now that ſinne will damn it, and that faith would ſave it, but how to get out of the Wilderneſſe of ſin, or how to get into the way of faith, never doth the Miniſter ſhew; and this is the guidance of <hi>generall Preaching.</hi> A ſad inſtance of ſuch Preaching, and an happy inſtance of the contrary we have at once in one Preacher, &amp; upon one hearer. <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>David
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115802:86"/> Nathan</hi> he forms a curious and elegant ſtory, wherein he lively &amp; wittily reproves <hi>Davids ſin to</hi> Davids <hi>very face.</hi> 2 Sam. 12. the four firſt verſes; Now mark as hee Preaches in the generall, ſo <hi>David</hi> aſſents in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and is convinced in the generall. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. as <hi>the Lord lives</hi> ſaith <hi>David, the man ſhall die that did this.</hi> Why? <hi>David</hi> was the man. But yet for all the beating of the very buſh that <hi>David</hi> was hid in, till <hi>David</hi> himſelf comes by particular and plain dealing to bee ſmitten upon, the generall conviction is not worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to him, but himſelfe lies ſecure in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of ſin ſtill. But when <hi>Nathan</hi> comes <hi>to preach particularly,</hi> David <hi>begins to apply particularly,</hi> and when <hi>Nathan ſmites him,</hi> he <hi>ſmites upon his own breaſt. [Thou] art the man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nathan,</hi> ver. 7.

If a <hi>Peter,</hi> a Father, a Friend, that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to boote, be uſed by Satan as his ſnare for thee, to draw thee into any ſinfull carnall way, let thy heart look to it ſelf now.<note place="margin">Or have falſe apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> We are ready to ſuſpect counſel to be carnal, from thoſe that are carnal; but if it be a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> that perſwades us to ſpare our ſelves, we think not ſo then: ſo if godly perſons have, or declare falſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115802:88"/> conceptions about any thing, we are ready to take all to be as true that comes from them, as the grace that is in them.</p>
                  <p>I have have had to doe with ſome poore, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, ſincere hearts, that have had nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, (I meane, as to their ſincerity) but that ſuch a Godly Party told them (in a paſſion) that they might be Hypocrites for all their progreſſe ſo far; and truly I had much adoe to faſten ſatisfaction upon them, but that it muſt needs therefore be, that the work of Grace was counterfeit in them. Godly Miniſters had need take heed that they ſpeake not more or leſſe to diſtreſſed Conſciences, then the Word will warrant, for ſuch poore ſoules are prone to take all for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (eſpecially at ſuch a time) that ſuch an one ſhall ſay, of whom they are perſwaded, that he is Godly, and ſo perhaps by an inconſiderate word, we may make the heart ſad, that God would not have to bee made ſad, as the ſpeech is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. So if Godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons undervalue, or miſconſtrue Providences, they ſhall hardly doe it alone. How little due notice is taken of the operations of Gods hands, when any eminent for godlineſſe are either (with reaſon) diſtaſted with the Meanes, or poſſibly (without reaſon) <hi>Jonah-like</hi> diſpleaſed with the Mercies. So if any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Holineſſe, erre either in judgement or life, how feareleſſe doe others follow? O ſuch a one I know to be godly,<note place="margin">Or decline to any evill way.</note> and I am confident he durſt not ſpeake it if it were not ſo, and would never embrace it, if it were not good. You have <hi>Peter under</hi> a temptation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Paul</hi> charges him, that <hi>he walked not uprightly,</hi> nor <hi>according to the truth of the Goſpell:</hi> and what comes of it? Why, other <hi>Jews</hi> diſſembled alſo, and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> (the Saint) <hi>was carried away with their diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> v. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Querie.</hi> But you will ſay, How ſhall I doe to know Satans voice from <hi>Peters,</hi> ſince (it ſeemes) Satan can
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115802:88"/> ſpeake in <hi>Peter:</hi> or how ſhall I do to walk in the waies of <hi>Peter</hi> as a Saint, and to keep out of his paths, ſo far forth as ſinfull?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by looking beyond all,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> unto that guidance which is one, and which is above all. Thou maiſt, and muſt ſet the cloud of witneſſes before thee, and follow them, but thine eye muſt ſtill be fixt upon the firſt guide, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Seeing we are compaſſed about with a Cloud of witneſſes, let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us,</hi> verſe 1. <hi>Looking to Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> verſe 2.

                  <p>Oh that the Saints would exceedingly feare ſinning upon this accoune.

And it is better to go to the <hi>houſe of mourning</hi> at another ſeaſon, and upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother occaſion, <hi>Eccel.</hi> 7.2. Yea, in <hi>Religious Duties</hi> too; on theſe I ſhall inſiſt, becauſe its Satans great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe herein, and hereby to bewilder us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall for inſtance pitch upon our two great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne occaſionall duties, <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Thanſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> (although ſome proportion of theſe are as blood and water that runne through all our veynes, and muſt runne through all our ſpirituall exerciſes:<note place="margin">Inſtance.</note>) you ſhall too often find</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when God calls us to <hi>ſoul-humbling,</hi> our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are for rejoycing and refreſhing: for this God challengeth Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>In the day of your faſt you find pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, When God calls us to ſoul-rejoycing, our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are then for ſoul-humbling. This God reproveth alſo in the ſame people at another time, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.9. <hi>This day is holy to the Lord, weep not, neither mourn, for all the people wept,</hi> and verſe 10. <hi>Goe your way, eat the fat; and drink the ſweet, and ſend portions, &amp;c. neither be ye ſorry, for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> verſe 10.</p>
                  <p>Now Satan hath great advantage hereunto through our ignorance: for ſurely the the people thought they did dwell in weeping: Why? 'twas for their ſinnes when they heard the <hi>Law read:</hi> 'twas for offending God that they wept; could this at any time be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable? Yes, that meaſure of it now was, and to bee reproved, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezrah</hi> did. And thus doth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115802:89"/> Satan by the guidance of ſome other miſtaken duty, turne us aſide from that frame of ſpirit, that wee ought to have in the preſent duty. When God bids them <hi>mourne,</hi> they find pleaſure; when he cals them to find <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and to rejoyce before him,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they <hi>mourn bitterly.</hi> Thou maiſt be affectionate in a <hi>ſin,</hi> thinking it verily to be a <hi>dutie.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Querie.</hi> But now here lies the difficulty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. We are commanded to <hi>rejoyce with trembling;</hi> how then can Satan be ſaid to leade us out of the way by the one, from the other, when both together are our duty? and if ſo, how could Iſrael be reproved for their <hi>mourning,</hi> in the day of their <hi>rejoycing?</hi> ſince rejoycing is not as it ſhould be without trembling; nor (by the ſame Rule, and Scripture) muſt <hi>trembling</hi> be without <hi>rejoycing: rejoyce with your trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, I apprehend it true, that there muſt be ſomething of an Humiliation day in every Thanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, if rightly managed; and ſomething of a Thanſgiving in every ſoul-afflicting day, elſe may wee mourne our ſelves into deſpaire, or joy our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preſumption. Surely there's no contrariety in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, therefore two different duties may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the ſame ſubject, at the ſame time; and one frame of ſpirit made up of both, fit for either: but withall, the duty of the day muſt (as we ſay) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the day, or elſe we ſinne. In a Thankſgiving day we muſt <hi>rejoyce with trembling:</hi> in an Humiliation, we muſt <hi>tremble with rejoycing.</hi> Now Satans buſineſſe is, to tranſport us beyond due bounds, by poyſing our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits moſt unto that whereof ſhould be leaſt, as was clear in thoſe inſtances, and is too often in our expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſo to bewilder us in duty by duty. If you'l aske how much muſt there then be of trembling in our holy Feaſts? or of rejoycing in our Faſts? I anſwer, juſt ſo much as makes us fitter for the due management of the preſent duty. A little of ſpiriuall joy gives advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115802:90"/> as your experiences can ſpeak, unto the due gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of godly ſorrow. And a little trembling rightly attempers holy rejoycing, and whatſoever is <hi>more then thus commeth of evill.</hi> Now Satans buſineſſe is to make us loſe our ſorrowes in rejoycing, or our joy in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and our ſelves into both, and ever moſt of that whereof the preſent day and duty calls for leaſt; and thus may not onely a <hi>Felix</hi> want a convenient ſeaſon, but you Saints may find it difficult to redeeme a ſeaſon for ſoule-ſearching from prayer, or for reſolving upon Reformation afterward in a ſerious ſort from ſoul-ſearching: You may enlarge it in other inſtances, as his bewildring our Meditations, by enclining us then to pray, or to break us off from prayer, by injecting uſefull Meditations (as formerly I have hinted) and the like to theſe.</p>

                     </note>SEventhly, The next meanes of this ſort (that I ſhall name) is Satans plotting to lead us out of the way of true and reall grace, by the falſe guidance of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. I ſhall give you one inſtance. There is not any Grace in the world, that doth better accord with, and more ſtrengthen another, then Faith and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doe mutually: Yet is there not any thing whereby Satan turnes poore afflicted ſpirits more aſide from the way of believing, then the falſe guidance of pretenſive humility. As now when the ſoule lyeth convicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115802:90"/> the ſence of its being in it ſelfe poore and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſerable, and blind, and naked; the ſoule hath nothing to doe next, but to buy <hi>of Chriſt Gold try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fire,</hi> and <hi>white Rayment, and Eyeſalve,</hi> &amp;c. that is, whatſoever a loſt ſinner needs in order to ſalvation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3:17. And Chriſt tearms are <hi>without monie,</hi> and <hi>without price,</hi> Iſai. 55.1. So then ſuch a ſoule is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enjoyned upon its allegiance to God, whoſe Commandment it is, That <hi>we ſhould believe,</hi> and upon righteous principles of Selfe-preſervation, freely to take as the <hi>waters of life</hi> are freely tendred, and by acting faith upon a promiſe, and with a bare hand to take hold, and to leane upon Chriſt, and ſo to come up from the Wilderneſſe. Wilt thou then, or wilt thou not? ſpeake thou that needeſt a Chriſt, wilt thou have one? Oh! ſaith the ſoule, I would faine have a Chriſt, I need him, I ſee I am undone without him; but I am naked, ragged, and aſhamed to come to him in this dreſſe; I am leprous, and filthy, my hands are not clean, and I dare not with ſuch hands take hold upon him: Humility forbids me; ſtay but till I have got better Clothes, (as ſome will ſay of their comming to Church) and have waſhed my ſelfe, and then i'le com, I am affraid and aſhamed to come before. And wilt thou ſtay from Chriſt till thou canſt fit thy ſelfe for him? even ſtay an eternity, ile warrant thee thou'lt ne're be fit. And is this humility? thou lyeſt Satan, 'tis Pride, and the height of it too, even of Goſpel-pride, to thinke that without Chriſts Sumpter, thou ſhalt be ever able to give Chriſt fit entertainment. Soules call it humility, to get ſomething for a preſent for the Lord Chriſt, as <hi>Jacob</hi> for his Lord <hi>Eſau;</hi> but this in thee is Pride, as in him it was Policy: Thou call'ſt it Humility, but God calls it Pride, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They have not ſubmitted to the righteouſneſſe of God;</hi> a ſad word. Its meere pride, and ſtoutneſſe, and high-ſpiritedneſſe, the wretched remainders of unbroken-heartedneſſe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115802:91"/> (what ever Satan tells thee) that onely is humility, that makes thee intirely cloſe with the Righteouſneſs of faith, with Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, upon Chriſts own tearms.</p>

                     </gap>ken Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this is now much in faſhion, and prevailing in the world. Time was, when <hi>ignorance</hi> was in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for men to walke in blind purſuance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuppoſed light: So in Popiſh times, many cared not for, nor at all enquired into the Scripture. Then for the Prieſt to doe as the Prelate did, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the Prieſt did, was enough. But our times have ſeene the Scriptures brought more into uſe, and almoſt every one, at (leaſt in profeſſion) will ſay, as <hi>David</hi> (and as it's fit they ſhould) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a light unto my feet, and a lanthorn to my paths.</hi> Men will not now take things to bee ſo, becauſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaid it; but they will, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, ſearch the Scripture, and truly 'tis not onely the uſe, but the faſhion now. Now marke, when Satan ſeeth that wee are ſo much for Scripture, and that the way to bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us is by preſſing Scripture; truly (as formerly hee laboured to ſuppreſſe it) now he will preſſe it, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it too;<note place="margin">Note</note> as a Tyrant by plain torture, to make the guiltleſſe Scriptures to ſpeake againſt themſelves: ſay you ſo, ſaith Satan? are you for light? i'le fit your turne by dreſſing my ſelfe as an <hi>Angell of light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Satan will quote Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> 2 Cor. 11.13, 14. And thus by falſe glimmerings of the true, but miſrepreſented light, Satan turneth ſoules aſide into the ſhady Thickets of the Wilderneſs, even into Workes of darkneſſe.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for hee leaves out that clauſe, that would have mar'd the logick of the temptation, <hi>viz. he ſhall keep thee in all thy waies;</hi> which caſting himſelf down from the Pinacle, could not be. You have mention of ſome that <hi>wreſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own perdition.</hi> 2. Pet. 3.16. They turne the Scriptures out of the way, that they themſelves may with more ſecurity and freedom turn aſide: and this trade they take up, as you ſee, from their father the Devill.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give you amongſt many,<note place="margin">1. An inſtance in two ſorts of perſons.</note> but a double inſtance the one of perſons, the other as to times. For the firſt,</p>

There are ſome that never frequent Ordinances, or take any paines either in publick or private with their own ſoules, and ask them why they are ſo negligent in the weighty things of God and their own ſoules? Why? ſay they, doe not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves teach as (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44.) that <hi>we cannot come to God, except he draw us:</hi> we do but ſtay for his drawing. If we ſhould take never ſo much paines, all would do no good, <hi>Without him we can do nothing</hi> (as Joh. 15.5.) and would you not have us ſtay for his coming. <hi>If the ſpirit moveth us we ſhall pray, and if God turn us we ſhall be turned, and when God wills, we ſhall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115802:92"/> believe, and repent,</hi> and <hi>till God pleaſe, we by our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours can do nothing.</hi> This is the language of many hearts, and upon this, their practice is to ſit ſtill: and what is this other then to be quietly kept in the Lyons Den?<note place="margin">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for ſuch as endeavour, but truſt to what they do; theſe are as far out as the other. Ask them, what will you make your prayers, your righteouſneſſe, your alms, your attendance upon the word, your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, your Saviour? will you reſt there? why? thoſe as you have heard, are but part of the waies of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe ſtill. Say you ſo? ſaith that ſoul, nay, but you ſhall never make me believe that: doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay: <hi>waſh you, make you clean,</hi> Iſa. 1.16. <hi>Caſt away your tranſgreſſions, make you a new heart and a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, why will you die, turn your ſelves and live you.</hi> Ezek. 18.31, 32. Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>If you be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land.</hi> Iſa. 1.19. Why? I have done thus, and I have been thus, and why ſhould not I expect to live by what I have done, and to receive what God hath promiſed, as I have done what God hath commanded? And ſo when the forementioned ſoul ſhall come, and tell God that he is an <hi>auſtere Maſter, gathering where he did not ſow,</hi> if he bid them do what the Scripture ſaith they cannot do; as that wicked ſervant. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.21, The later wil come, and boaſt, and glory in himſelfe as that wicked Phariſee. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. <hi>God, I thank thee,</hi> I <hi>have been, and</hi> I <hi>have done ſo, and ſo.</hi> Now both theſe are out of the way, and yet they think that Scripture is their guide; as that blaſphemous Papiſt, who when he had vented his popiſh tenets, and as he pretended, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thought, managed them by Scripture, hee breaks out in a wretched rapture, <hi>If I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be deceived, decepiſti ô Petre, decepiſti ô Paule: Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had deceived him, Scripture had deceived him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the reſt forgets that which was trueſt, that

But now that we may come at this true guidance, I ſhall entreat you to deal by Scripture, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Prophets. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>The ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> Let's hear what the Scriptures can ſay, that put the ſoul upon working, as if it had a ſelf-ability: and lets hear what thoſe ſpeake alſo, that call the ſoul off from leaning upon its owne indeavours, as being when it hath done all, an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervant; and lets hear what a third ſhall judge of them both, and ſurely if both kinds of Scriptures ſhould ſeem to ſtrive (as I may ſo ſay) a third would come in and ſay as he ſaid <hi>(&amp; vitulo tu dignus &amp; ille eſt)</hi> both have wonne. Read but <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.13 <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and and to doe of his own good pleaſure.</hi> You muſt work it out, yet it is God that worketh in you. It is God that worketh in you of his own good pleaſure; yet you muſt work it out: yea, and therefore; for it is God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now then all the week the men of the World ſpend peaceably in ſeeking onely after the World,<note place="margin">1. Weekdaies.</note> all the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115802:93"/> week-daies, I ſay, and they would not have you blame them for it; if they hear a Lecture now and then, they think that's more then they need to do, the Miniſter is beholding to them for their Company, and God for their attendance, and they'l have Scripture to follow too: Why? is it not written, <hi>Six daies thou ſhalt labour.</hi> 'Tis true ſay I, but again is it not written, <hi>therein thou ſhalt do all that thou haſt to do?</hi> and haſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do for a poor ſoul? haſt thou a Family to provide for, and many things, to do (as <hi>Martha</hi>) about them? and haſt thou no proviſion to make for a poore ſoule? of a truth this is exceeding ſad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Lords-day.</note>Again, when the Lords day comes, then ſome in the City or in the Town ſleep it, &amp; eat and drink it almoſt all away, riſing that morning very late, (as having ſate up very late the night before at work) and goe that night to bed very early (that they may be up ſoon on monday morning to follow the World.) They take their penniworths out of the ſleep of their Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the week before, and they willingly ſuffer their Apprentices to take their penniworths out of the Lords day, morning and evening: and they will tell you they have Scripture for it too, why doth not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it a <hi>day of reſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, as for thoſe that live in the Country, and have other kind of affairs; they think if they wait but on the publick Ordinances they do hugely well, for, as for all their other time they ſpend it in foddering, or milkng, or looking after their Oxen, and ſwine, and ſheep and the like. And doth not Scripture tell them they may do ſo? they'l tell you that Chriſt allowes it them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.11. But doth not Chriſt that allowes thee to pull an <hi>Oxe out of a ditch upon the Sabbath:</hi> much more require thee to pull thy poor ſoul out of the fire with fear and trembling? Thou thinkſt it is fit to look after a dumb Creature that is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115802:93"/> gone aſtray upon the Lords day, and may periſh if thou looke not after it, and the Sabbath thoul't ſay, from Scripture, is <hi>a day of mercy.</hi> True, but doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give thee leave in ſuch a day, to be onely cruell to thine owne ſoule? that that may be loſt and wander in the Wilderneſſe, and never bee lookt after? Oh! take heed whileſt you pretend to be led by Scripture-guidance, leſt you become unrighteous Judges of the Scriptures in your own thoughts; though God hath ſaid: That <hi>he will have mercy and not ſacrifice;</hi> yet how canſt thou thinke, that in ſuch a day, God will have mercy ſhown to Beaſts, and to Bodies, and not to Souls?</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee how Satan makes it his buſineſſe by Scripture-guidance, to bewilder ſoules; I could multiply inſtances.<note place="margin">Inſtance in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas! how doe poore diſtreſſed Conſcience urge Scriptures againſt themſelves, to hinder themſelves from laying hold on Jeſus Chriſt, and to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of themſelves, and their courſes even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair?</p>
                  <p>And how doe bold prophane ſinners urge Scripture for themſelves, and for their ſinnes,<note place="margin">And bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers.</note> to hinder their ſoules from being humbled unto converſion, and to the juſtifying of themſelves and their courſes even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that preſumption? I tremble to think, and I dare not ſpeake, what I have heard in this kind, leſt I ſhould put a ſword into any mad mans hand, whereby hee might kill himſelfe, unleſſe I had time enough (as to each particular) to take it out of his hand againe. I have heard Tipling, Chambering, long Haire, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the face, &amp;c. defended, and pittifully too, by abuſing, and by wreſting holy Scriptures: But ſurely they that ſinne by Scripture-ſhelter, will have a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Comforter of it in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe there's ſo much danger of being loſt under a miſtaken Scripture-guidance, I dare not leave
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115802:94"/> the Saints without a word of ſerious Exhortation, that by frequent prayer they would effectually and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, put in ſuit that precious Scripture-promiſe concerning the holy Scripture-guide, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>I will ſend the Comforter,</hi> ver. 7. and <hi>when he, who is the ſpirit of truth ſhall come, he ſhall guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe, but whatſoever he ſhall heare, that ſhall he ſpeak.</hi> And thus much of Satans bewildring ſouls by falſe guidances.

They <hi>that are drunk n,</hi> are <hi>drunken in the night,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.7. And ſo for other ſinnes: for a drunken ſinner, is a notable reſemblance of every bewildred ſinner, ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.14. They <hi>have cauſed Aegypt to erre, as a drunken man ſtaggereth.</hi> A drunken man cannot keepe the way, no more can er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a bewildred people, or perſon; they ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out of the way, firſt on one hand, then on the other, and this is in the night; the dark gives advantage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſo <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.8. <hi>You were darkneſſe ſometimes,</hi> though now <hi>you are light in the Lord</hi> (therefore) <hi>walke</hi> (as who ſhould ſay, <hi>it's good walking now.</hi>) If our light be darkneſſe, ſure our walk will be a Wilderneſſe.

Its Satans work then to caſts miſts, and fogges, and thick darkneſſe before the eyes of poore Creatures, and ſo to blind their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Now what darkneſſe is in Naturalls,<note place="margin">Or ignorance. <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is in Spiritualls: And as Darkneſſe bewilders Travelling perſons outwardly, ſo Ignorance bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders travelling ſoules, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. They <hi>are all gone out of the way:</hi> Why? What's the reaſon? verſe 11. <hi>There's none that underſtandeth,</hi> verſe 17. <hi>The way of peace they have not known:</hi> ſo Heb. 3.10. <hi>They do alwaie erre in their heart</hi> (and what's the reaſon ſtill?) and they <hi>have not known my waies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But will you ſay, if ignorance be the cauſe of ſoul-bewildrings, whence is it that ſo many that have much knowledge, and light enough to come out of the Wilderneſſe, keep there ſtill?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solu.</hi> I deny that. There is not any ſoule that's in the wilderneſſe, that hath enough of true light to helpe it thence. Verily, all the notionall knowledge,<note place="margin">Note</note> and brain-light in the world, is little better then darkneſſe, if not darkneſſe according to that intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23. <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkneſſe,</hi> how <hi>great will that darkneſſe be?</hi> and I would have you know, that all the knowledge the head can hold, is not enough to diſentangle the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildrings of the heart.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſees could ſay, <hi>we ſee,</hi> they had ſooner got out of the Wilderneſſe, if they had <hi>been blind,</hi> as Chriſt tells them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.41.

Thoſe that are bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the dark, they are they know not where, they go they know not whither, they ſtumble they know not at what, they fall they know not when: and thus it is with bewildred and benighted Sinners.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1. They are they know not where.</note>1. <hi>They are they know not where.</hi> If you ſhould meet a bewildred Traveller on an Heath, or in a Forreſt, in a dark night, and ſhould aske him where he is? hee might ſay, I am here: here, yea but where is that? truly, muſt he ſay, I know not well where I am. Thus God demands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the Diſputer of this world?</hi> Where? Why? the <hi>wiſe man</hi> is at the Councill, you will ſay: the <hi>Diſputer</hi> is in the Schoole: the <hi>Scribe</hi> is at the Deske: Ah poore wretches, themſelves know not where they are, elſe why doth God aske the Queſtion: ſo likewiſe <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.12. ſaith God, <hi>Where are the wiſe men &amp;c.</hi> I will warrant you, they thought they could give a very full anſwer, a very faire and prudent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hereof, where they were, what they were doing, and how to come off, they thought, no doubt, they knew well enough: but, God knows, they know not.

I know I am the keeper of my Moneys, and Means, and I know where they are; but where my ſoule is, truly I know not, if there be ſuch a thing, I never knew that I was the keeper of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe that are bewildred in the dark,<note place="margin">2ly, The goe they know not whither.</note> they goe they know not whither, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35. He <hi>that walketh in the dark, knowes not whither he goes:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He walketh in darkneſſe, and knoweth not whither be goes, becauſe the darkneſſe hath blinded his eyes:</hi> So he that walks in the Works of darkneſſe, knowes not whither he goes. The way may ſeem right unto him (as you have heard from <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.25.) but what the end is knows he not, for the <hi>end of thoſe waies is death.</hi> The young man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. went he thought to a <hi>carved bed, &amp;c.</hi> but indeed he knew not whither he went, for he went as <hi>a bird that haſtneth to the ſnare,</hi> and <hi>knoweth not that it is for his life,</hi> ver. 23. So Drunkards drinke drunk, and Swearers blaſpheme, and Cheaters cozen,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115802:96"/> and Hypocrites dallie with, and prophane ones tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the things of God, and little do they know that all this is for damnation: ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Her waies are moveable, that thou canſt not know them.</hi> What, doth not the Drunkard, and Oppreſſor, and Adulterer, know his own way? No, he doth not, neither can hee know them. He knowes perhaps what they begin at, but where they end he knows not, whither they go he knows not, becauſe they are all of them in the darke. Alas! who <hi>knows the power of Gods wrath?</hi> Pſal. 90.11. Who knowes the infinity of his juſtice? who knowes how much ſinne deſerves? or how much the ſinner ſhall ſuffer? Sirs, then let me aske you this day, and let your Conſciences anſwer, <hi>Whither away ſo faſt?</hi> ſirs, where are you going, you that make ſuch haſt after your pleaſures, ſuch haſt to be rich? where are you go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? to <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Heaven?</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Devill?</hi> Oh! where will you lye down at night? where will you lodge when you come to dye? you that are ſo haſty in your journey, that you can't ſtay to bait at a <hi>Lecture,</hi> where doe you think you ſhall lodge at night, that you make ſo much haſt now? That's a ſad demand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 10.3. <hi>What will you do in the day of Viſitation, and where will you leave your glory?</hi> ſaith God. Sirs, every ones maſter ſinne is his glory; yea, though it be their ſhame: it is yet that which they glory in, as one in his Pride, another in his unrighteous Mammon, a third in his profuſeneſſe, &amp;c. Every Traveller upon the Road of this World, hath a truſs behind him of that which hee counts his glory: but now let me aske you, yea rather God demands of you, and anſwer you him. Oh! where will you lay downe your Truſs at night? Oh! where will you leave your glory? You know where you tooke up your Honours, and upon what termes: you know where you took up your Eſtates, and upon what termes: whether with a good Conſcience, yea,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115802:96"/> or no: But oh! where will you leave them? leave them you muſt, nothing more ſure; but where? Why? with my Sonne thinks one in ſuch an Inheritance, and with my Daughter thinks another in ſuch a Portion: Thus in their inward thought, that their <hi>Houſes ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever,</hi> Pſal. 49.11. but verſe 13. This <hi>their way is their folly:</hi> thou fool, thou neither knowſt whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy ſelfe, nor they are a going. In the darke thou haſt taken them up, in the darke thou ſhalt loſe them; in the darke it is that thou walkeſt, and whither thou goeſt thou doſt not know. Oh! let this Querie bee a ſtop to your ſpeedy courſe, and poſt-haſt in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Wilderneſſe. Often aske your ſelves this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when paſſion begins to get up, or any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>ô animula, Quo vadis?</hi> O my poore ſoule! whither is it that thou art now a going?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They that are bewildred in the darke,<note place="margin">3ly, They ſtumble they know not at what,</note> ſtumble at they know not what, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.9. <hi>If any man walke in the day, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world,</hi> verſe 10. But if any <hi>man walk in the night he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this you ſhall find expreſly of ſinne too, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.19. <hi>The way of the wicked is as darkneſſe,</hi> they <hi>know not at what they ſtumble.</hi> Tell a wicked man that hee gets a fall, and a bruiſe by every ſinne, he knowes it not, he's not ſenſible of it. Ile mind you in a word or two, of what you ſtumble at, and tell me whether you have been ſenſible thereof or no: I remember God ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If ſuch a one ſinne, and I lay a ſtumbling block before him.</hi> There's not a ſinner of you, but God hath laid ſtumbling blocks before you, and without all peradventure, you have ſtumbled over them, and yet I believe you have not known at what you have ſo ſtumbled. Ile inſtance therefore in two things. 1.<note place="margin">Inſtance.</note> Gods Works. 2, His. Word. God in his Works: Chriſt in his Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Dark ſoules, and bewildred ſinners,<note place="margin">1. In Gods providence.</note> ſtumble
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115802:97"/> at all Gods providences, and it know it not. I tell you, you ſtumble over your very Tables which your bread ſtands upon, over your very Beds that your bodies lye upon, over your very Houſes that you dwell in, &amp;c. and this I feare you have not known, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.12. They (he ſpeakes of rich voluptuous ones) <hi>conſider not Gods works, nor the operations of his hands,</hi> and what's the reaſon, verſe 13. <hi>They are without knowledge (i. e.</hi> they are in the dark) and what of this? Why? they ſtumble and fall, and ſadly too, ſo as to riſe up no more; for verſe 14. Therefore <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>opened her mouth without meaſure,</hi> and their <hi>glory,</hi> and their <hi>multitude,</hi> and he that <hi>rejoyceth, ſhall deſcend into it.</hi> Doe you think that joviall ſinners, think that Gods providences are ſuch a ſtone of ſtumbling? No, they have no knowledge thereof. There are ſome that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that Sunne, Moon, and Stars, preach Chriſt, I am farre from thinking, that Creation, or providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, are enough to be a <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, to lead us up to Heaven: but thus much I know, that they are too many as a ſtone to ſtumble at (who know not that the goodneſſe of God (in them) <hi>ſhould lead us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mercies.</note> (as Rom. 2.4. Thou ſtumbleſt at the Globe of the Sunne, or of the Moon, that diſhonoureſt God by day, or by night, under the light of the one, or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the other.</p>
                  <p>Yea, other ſorts of providential Diſpenſations there are, as Corrections; and at theſe the darkned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred ſoules ſtumble:<note place="margin">Chaſtiſements</note> if they be not as ſtaires to help them nearer unto God, they will be as ſtumbling ſtones over which they fall, and on which they ſhall be broken, ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Why ſhould they be ſtriken any more? they will revolt more and more:</hi> it followes, <hi>the whole head is ſick, and heart is heavy; from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is nothing but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrified ſores.</hi> Oh! who ſees not what ſtumbling here hath been? Sirs, the day is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115802:97"/> comming, when you ſhall know that upon every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction whereby you have not riſen to more holineſſe, and faith, and obedience, &amp;c. You have ſtumbled, to wit, the day wherein you ſhall be made ſenſible of the wounds and bruiſes that now are in your Conſciences; but now you are in the heat of blood, the heat of ſinne, and like wounded Souldiers, go on ſtill without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Bewildred &amp; benighted ſinners,<note place="margin">2ly, Gods word, and at Chriſt therein</note> ſtumble at the Word of God, and at Jeſus Chriſt in that word, yet know it not. In every Sermon, where Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and tendred, they ſtumble at him; and you may ſay of theſe, as of thoſe that Crucified him, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaid, That they <hi>know not what they do. Peter</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. That <hi>to them that believe Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but unto them that are diſobedient,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>he is a ſtone of ſtumbling,</hi> and <hi>a Rock of offence,</hi> even to <hi>them which ſtumble at the Word,</hi> as 1 Cor. 1.23. Chriſt <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the Jews, is a ſtumbling block.</hi> Onely now take heed that it be not with you, as with one that gets a fall when he is drunk, and feels it not till he be ſober: therefore give glory to God, before your feet ſtumble on the <hi>dark mountains,</hi> Jer. 13.16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Bewildred and bedarkned ſinners,<note place="margin">4ly, They fall they know not when.</note> fall they know not when; ſuddainly, or ever they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.

I believe when the foole was that night caſt into <hi>Hell,</hi> he could not but be in a more ſad extaſie than one that ſhould of the ſuddaine tumble into a Lyons Den. Ah! <hi>Lord, what am I here? am I here Lord?</hi> — What <hi>in Hell?</hi> in Hell? I dream't not of it. Alas my Brethren, now adayes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, becauſe <hi>ſentence is not ſpeedily executed againſt an evil work, therefore the hearts of the Sons of men are fully ſet in them to do evill,</hi> Eccleſ.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115802:98"/> 8.11. But faire and ſoftly, perhaps more ſuddainly then thou art aware of, <hi>Jer</hi> 51.8. Babylon <hi>is ſuddainly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> Marke, her fall is ſuddaine to her, ſhee knowes not of it, down ſhe goes, and is not aware of it. We would <hi>have healed her,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>but ſhe would not be healed,</hi> verſe 9. God commonly ſnatches ſoules that are under healing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,, and refuſe to be healed, ſuddainly away. So God threatneth to ſend a <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> (as a Lyon of the Forreſt, that falls ſuddainly upon his prey) to fall ſuddainly upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Becauſe they had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God,</hi> verſe 6. Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. <hi>They were perverted,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>evill ſhall come upon thee, that thou ſhalt not know whence it riſeth, and miſchiefe that thou ſhalt not be able to put off,</hi> and <hi>deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddainly that thou ſhalt not know.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.10. You have them turned out <hi>of the way,</hi> and verſe 11. <hi>truſting in ſuch perverſeneſſe;</hi> verſe 12. and therefore <hi>iniquity</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall be to you, as a breach ſwelling in an</hi> high wall, ready <hi>to fall,</hi> whoſe <hi>breaking forth commeth ſuddainly at an inſtant.</hi> Oh! if it had not been ſo ſuddaine, the people might have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the houſe. So if they had not gone to Hell in ſuch a moment, ſuch an unexpected moment, they may imagine they would have prevented it. But hee that is bewildred in the darke, falls hee knowes not when. Oh! firs, if you might die of Conſumptions, (which you ſay are fine repenting times) if you might know of death ſome years before hand: Oh! you think you would be ready then: but this ſuddaine, ſuddaine falling that you ſhall not know of, whence or when it ſhall be, yet it certainly ſhall be, let this ſtartle you.</p>
                  <p>In one word or two then from what I have this day been ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that ſoules are uſually ſo blind, becauſe of ſpirituall darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Vſes of theſe generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</note> that they know not where they are, whither they are a going, what it is they ſtumble
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115802:98"/> at, and are alſo ready to fall they know not when? Oh then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Admire the exceeding mery of the Lord, that he ſhould ever, (as at this day) ſend a guide with a light in his hand unto thee, ſo bewildred in the dark, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.78, 79. <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God, the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us</hi> (that's Chriſt in the Goſpell) <hi>to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death,</hi> and to <hi>guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> Oh! that was tender mercy indeed, let it be tenderly accepted by you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let it be as carefully improved. Let not an hard heart loſe the ſweetneſſe of ſuch tender mercy. My Brethren, Chriſt is come in the dark unto you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſſe, he hath bruiſed himſelf, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own feet: yea, even pierced them through in comming to you, and that he might bring you a light, and lead you into the way that you have loſt. Is it a ſmall thing to you, that he ſhould appoint this, and that man to ſhew you the way of ſalvation? as they ſay, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.17. if it be, yet think it not a light matter, that the <hi>light</hi> himſelfe is come to bee your guide: Chriſt is come into the darkſome wilderneſſe of the wicked World, and now take heed of loving your <hi>darkneſs</hi> rather then <hi>light,</hi> for Jeſus himſelf ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35, 36. <hi>Yet a little while the light is with you, walk whilſt you have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you: for he that walketh in the dark, knows not whither he goes. While ye have light, believe in the light, that you may be Children of the light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have you heard in ſome generall Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how bewildring ſpirituall darkneſſe is: I ſhall conclude them with an Obſervation from the form of the expreſſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>Have I been a Wilderneſſe to Iſrael?</hi> a <hi>land of darkneſs?</hi> When ever Satan leads you into a Land of Darkneſſe, he leads you therein into a Wilderneſſe.

                     <note place="margin">1. Stupidity and ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>Firſt, The darkneſſe of ſenceleſſe ſtupidity, and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ignorance. It may well be called darkneſſe, and you know 'tis a bewildring darkneſſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.3. The <hi>Ox knows,</hi> but <hi>Iſrael doth not know:</hi> The bruit Beaſt knowes what's good for it ſelfe, but bruitiſh Men and Women doe not know. You complaine of a ſottiſh poore in your Towne, that have no more ſence of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good, then the ſtones of the ſtreets that they tread upon, and the blocks that they ſit on. You know that ſtocks and ſtones, if they bee in the wilderneſſe, there they ſtay, there they lie, they have no ſenſe to remove themſelves; but Beaſts, if they be in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, if danger approaches, if the Lyon roars, they have knowledge to runne for it, to change their place, poſture, and condition: but miſerable Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can hear the voice of the Lord in his providence, in his Word, as the roaring of a Lyon, and yet ſtay where they were, and as they were, and in the ſame poſture they were in, even in the Wilderneſſe of ſinne ſtill; and this is the reaſon they are blockiſhly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſtupid, as to ſpiritual things. Now unto what ſhall I liken the people of this Generation? 'tis even like unto Aegypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.21, 23. There was <hi>a thick
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115802:99"/> darkneſſe, darkneſs that might be felt, ſo that no man roſe from his place,</hi> for the time that that darkneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: ſo there is thick darkneſſe upon theſe Spirits; ſo that though they be in an Aegypt, in a Wilderneſſe, they ſtirre not, becauſe it is a <hi>Land of darkneſs:</hi> wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearts that mind onely to day, what they ſhall <hi>eate,</hi> and what they ſhall <hi>drink,</hi> and wherewith they ſhall be <hi>cloathed</hi> (and perhaps ſcarce that) but how to ariſe ſpiritually from the place they ſit in, the condition that their ſoules are in, verily hereunto they have no knowledge: and thus they ſit <hi>in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death,</hi> Luk. 1.79. They ſit in darkneſſe, and though the ſhadow of death be there, yet 'tis dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore they continue in it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7. <hi>We are not of darkneſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, therefore <hi>let us not ſleep,</hi> for they <hi>that ſleep, ſleep in the night.</hi> This is that <hi>night,</hi> and that <hi>darkneſs,</hi> you may know it by their ſleepineſſe. When men are aſleep, you may ſpeak in the roome and they heare not: the Goſpell, the voice of God is in the midſt of this ſottiſh Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but they are in the night, in the dark, and aſleepe, and therefore it is that they receive it not. But unto ſuch, if there be any here, let me tenderly ſpeake as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13.12. v. 11. <hi>Know ye the time, that it is now high time to awake out of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

So may I, and dare I ſay, and you ſhall find it too true, that God will not own your ſottiſh hearts as his, in the day of the Lord, becauſe hee made you intelligent and knowing ſoules; and now the reſtitution of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to you is tendred in the Goſpell, ſo that the day is come, and the night is ſpent, but you ſit ſtill in your
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115802:100"/> places, as they in the Aegyption darkneſſe. Neither do I tell you this, but God himſelfe by the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt ſort of Darkneſs, and millions of them that are called the Chriſtian World, are bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by it.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to the</p>

                     <note place="margin">2ly, The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs.</note>The ſecond ſort of Darkneſſe, and that is Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſſe. You have this with the other, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider.</hi> Many of them are ſo ſtupid that they know not, and thoſe that know doe not conſider: this is alſo a bewildring Darkneſs; Read <hi>Job</hi> 34.24, 25, 27. <hi>He ſhall break in pieces mighty men without number.</hi> And when ſhall hee doe it? verſe 25. He <hi>ſhall overturn them in the night,</hi> and why doth he doe it? verſe 27. Becauſe they <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back from him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>and would not conſider any of his waies.</hi> I have obſerved that very few, either of the richeſt of all, or pooreſt of all, ever come to get out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; (but it is a middle ſort of perſons) what is the reaſon? Why, the very poore know not, and the very rich care not, they conſider not, they thinke the things of God are below their Cognizance, although through Education, their parts are ſublimated to ſome knowledge. Now this is here ſaid of the Inconſiderate Great ones (as was proved before of the bruitiſh poor ones) that they alſo periſh in the Dark, in the <hi>night the are overturned,</hi> verſe 25. If Inconſiderateneſſe then be ſuch a bewildring night of darkneſſe, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord doth ſo perſwade us to conſider our works, and waies, and that Satan doth ſo deſigne to hinder us, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Leſt thou ſhouldſt ponder the way of life, her waies are movable.</hi> Oh! Satan cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Keep <hi>thy feet, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>offer not the ſacrifice of fooles,</hi> for they <hi>conſider not that they do evill.</hi> 'Tis want of conſideration, that makes ſoules to loſe their footing, their ground, their way; but <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the <hi>path of thy feet,</hi> and thy <hi>waies ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Prov. 4.26. So that inconſiderateneſſe is as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yea, and it is a bewildring darkneſſe. Let me perſwade you therefore, that are intelligent to one ſtep forwarder; I meane to be adviſed, to ponder and lay to heart, the <hi>things</hi> that you know <hi>belong unto your peace.</hi> How many ſoules continue loſt under the means of knowledge, in the darkſome wilderneſſe of inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency and non-conſideration? <hi>I have conſidered my waies, and turned my feet into thy Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.58. And as for ſuch as will not conſider, let them know,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That though they conſider not their owne waies, yet they are conſidered, for God ponders them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.2. <hi>Every way of man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord ponders the hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God will make the moſt inconſiderate heart amongſt you, perfectly to conſider another day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.18. <hi>Who hath ſtood in the counſel of the Lord, and hath perceived and heard his word?</hi> Who hath <hi>marked his word and heard it?</hi> there's his challenge of their inconſiderateneſſe; but what followes, verſe 20? <hi>In the latter dayes you ſhall conſider it perfectly.</hi> You have heard of Inconſiderateneſſe in what they know of the things of God. The</p>

Can not? nay, they will not be perſwaded: As one that I once heard of, that in diſcourſe was directed to a place of Scripture, that ſpake point-blank againſt him, ſaith he, <hi>I can't find ſuch a place:</hi> ſaith the other, <hi>Look, here it is;</hi> nay then, ſaith he, <hi>I will not ſee't.</hi> So ſay you, We can't find what need wee have of Gods Counſell, and of Chriſt, and of Grace: ſaith God, looke here, and I will ſhew you what need you have, and how undone otherwiſe you are, &amp;c. Nay then, ſaith the Soule, I will not ſee. I remember a plaine Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Childe, where I was once, was playing in the Yard, and his Father out of the Window called him in; the Boy was eager of his play, and though his Father call'd againe and againe, yet came he not in; at length his Father told him that he would bee ſure to whip him, if he would not come, yet hee could not perſwade him in; at length in hee fetches him, and whips him, Sirrah, ſaith he, did not I tell you, that if you would not come in, I would laſh you; yes Father, ſaith the Childe, you ſaid ſo, but truly Father I did not believe you. So God calls, and exhorts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades ſinners, and tells them, if they will not now, they ſhall conſider afterward: if they will not come in now, they ſhall be fetch'd in, and damned to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether they will or no: And my Brethren, if
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115802:101"/> God ſhall (as he ſurely will (aske them at the great Day, Did not I call you by ſuch a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> by ſuch and ſuch a <hi>Sermon;</hi> and did not I tell you what would come on't. Hell, and Wrath, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ruine, if you came not in? Oh! the poor ſoule trembling and aſtoniſhed, will anſwer in that day, yes, <hi>Lord thou didſt ſo, but truly Lord we did not believe thee;</hi> thus are ſinners unperſwaſible ones, even the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of unperſwaſion. God cryes out, <hi>Turn ye at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; but when he calls, they refuſe,</hi> when he <hi>ſtretches out his hand, no man regardeth,</hi> Prov. 1.23, 24. And therefore though he calleth from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> from <hi>Amanah,</hi> from <hi>Shenir,</hi> and <hi>Hermon;</hi> yet they continue through their unperſwaſiblenſſe, in the Lyons Dens, and Mountaines of the Leopards yet ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Preſumption</hi> is alſo a bewildring darkneſs,<note place="margin">4ly, The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> and its buſineſſe is to hinder the ſoule from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To what ſhall I liken a preſuming ſinner? 'Tis even that beaſt, which when he is in danger of being ſeized on by the Lyon as his prey, runnes his head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into a buſh, and becauſe the head is in the dark, and ſees no danger, therefore it thinkes it ſelfe ſecure. Or as I have ſeen a Boy, that when his Father hath gone by at a diſtance, the lad hath hid his head behind another lad, ſo that he could not ſee his Father, and therefore hath beene very confident, that his Father hath not ſeen him. Preſumptuous ſinners runne their hearts into the thickets of the Wilderneſſe, they walk themſelves in the darke, not ſeeing God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preſume that the Lord takes no notice of them, and this verily is the very nature of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73.11. They ſay, <hi>how doth God know? and is there any knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> Pſa. 64.5. <hi>They commune of laying ſnares privily,</hi> they ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſee them?</hi> Wretches! that if they get but into a blind Ale-houſe, where the Magiſtrate can't ſee them, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſt all danger, when they are as much in it, as that Creature that while it turnes away its face from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115802:102"/> beholding its devourer, expoſeth its whole body to bee his prey: In ſuch a darkſome buſh ſhal a preſumptuous ſinner be caught, inſtead of being hid, and be deſtroyed inſtead of being ſecured; for <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.12. <hi>The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hideth not from God,</hi> but the <hi>night ſhines as the daie, the darkneſs and the light are both alike unto him.</hi> As to Gods eye and eare, thou hadſt as good the Magiſtrate ſhould heare every Oath thou ſweareſt; thou hadſt as good bee ſtaggering in the ſtreets, and whore, as <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> in the openeſt view, as to go into a Corner, and ſay, <hi>Doth God ſee it,</hi> becauſe thou turneſt away thine eyes from beholding of God.</p>

                     <note place="margin">5ly, The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſpair</note>Fifthly, <hi>Deſpair</hi> is alſo a bewildring darkneſſe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly obſtructive to converſion.

I have ſo long walked aſide from God, that if I ſhould now turne to him, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly turne quite away from me: this is the way of diſpaire, that many poore ones that are willing, if they durſt, to cloſe with God, are bewildred in; and this is called (which is pat to our purpoſe) a <hi>walking in darkneſſe,</hi> Iſai. 50.10. <hi>Who is there among you that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light,</hi> &amp;c. That is clearly and eminently to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the darkneſſe of black diſpaire. God would before, but they would not: they would now, but they are affraid that God will not, but let them ſtay upon the Lord; they may injure themſelves, and diſhonour God in this one farther work of Darkneſſe, as much as in all the reſt that were before it.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115802:103"/> good in their latter end,</hi> ver. 16. So when God intends to convert a ſoule, he brings it uſually, if not alwaies, firſt into a Wilderneſſe, but the deſigne of God is to humble it, and to prove it, and at length to doe it good. The firſt view that ſoules have of God, is as if his waies were a Wilderneſſe, a <hi>Land of darkneſſe,</hi> and it is the pleaſure of God it ſhould be ſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſſe,</hi> (that's a dark diſpenſation indeed) Oh! but then, ſaith God, <hi>I will ſpeak, comfortably to her.</hi> I will firſt bewilder her to humble her, and then at her latter end, <hi>I will do her good.</hi> Verily ſirs, if you will walke (as we all naturally doe) in the darke wilderneſſe of Soul-tranſgreſſion (though you be the deare Elect of God, yet) ſhall you walke in the darkſome wilderneſſe in Soul-affliction, and be as thoſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Walking in darkneſſe, and ſeeing no light at all.</hi> As God tells <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 20.34. &amp;c. ſo will he deal with the ſoule that he brings home to himſelfe; <hi>I will bring you out of the people,</hi> and ver. 35. <hi>I will bring you into the wilderneſs of the people,</hi> and there <hi>will I plead with you face to face,</hi> and verſe 37. <hi>I will cauſe you to paſſe under the Rod,</hi> and bring you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>bond of the Covenant,</hi> and verſe 38. <hi>I will purge out the Rebels from among you.</hi> Theſe are the pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and aims of God, in bringing ſoules into ſuch a Darkneſſe, into ſuch a Wilderneſſe, namely, to <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them out of other Countries (i. e.</hi> from the world, and their vaine Converſation) to cauſe them to paſſe under the <hi>Rod,</hi> (that is, to humble them, and to bring them, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, into a <hi>new bond of Covenant</hi>) and to purge out the Rebells, &amp;c. that is, by making ſinne (the hearts rebellion) a bitterneſs to their ſoules, to give Corruption a Deaths-wound in their ſoules.) As God of old by bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Wilderneſſe, thereby firſt brought them out of Aegypt, and then humbled them to purpoſe there, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither may a ſinner take this ill at the hands of God; for if he find a Convert perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his way, he will make him know, that he wae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the Wilderneſs, by bringing him back by an <hi>Hedge of thornes,</hi> and by ſetting <hi>darkneſs in his paths,</hi> and <hi>fencing up his waie that he cannot paſs;</hi> therefore wonder not at the Thornes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. or the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, verſe 14.

                  <p>I ſhall rank the bewildring-darkneſs of ſuch a day,<note place="margin">Of theſe three kinds.</note> under this Threefold Head: ſuch as reſpect <hi>our ſelves,</hi> ſuch as reſpect <hi>God,</hi> ſuch as reſpect the <hi>way of Reconcli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation betwixt us and God.</hi> All which God (at leaſt) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth for our good, though in them Satan purpoſeth our ruine.</p>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Sin revived, and I dyed:</hi> that is the ſence of ſinne; then it followes, verſe 11. <hi>For ſin taking occaſion by the Commandement deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</hi> When the terrours of the Law, joyne with the ſerious ſenſe of ſinne, and theſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the ſoul, this is the entangling killing wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the dark valley of the ſhadow of death.

Conſult with <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells you here, that he was deceived, but doth not tell you wherein, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of whom I am chiefe.</hi> Why? how could that bee? <hi>Paul</hi> was before Converſion, a ſober, blameleſſe man, as touching the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.

                  <p>But now comes Satan, as I ſaid before,<note place="margin">Darkning that ſplendor of Gods mercy unto us.</note> and his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to raiſe the darkſome fogges of thy ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and ſoul-bewildring thoughts; yet higher, ſo as not onely to bedarken all that is within thee, but to cloud the face of mercy, and to obſcure the glory of Chriſts undertakings, by the black guilt of thy ſinnes. Here is a worſe deceiving by the ſenſe of ſin (through Satans temptation) and this makes the formes Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe much more bewildring, and the poore loſt Creature ten thouſand times more at a loſs then it was before; when the ſoule comes to ſee its ſinnes greater, then any other ſinnes of the Children of men, Satan ſtriketh in, and takes advantage to make it account its ſinnes greater then any of Gods pardons; and this is a deceiving indeed unto ſlaying; and ſuch I believe was the dark bewildring ſence that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> had of their ſinnes; take heed, take heed of this deceipt in your ſenſibleneſs of your ſinnes; and yet even in this dark wilderneſs, are many deare unto God for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon left, and as it were, loſt till God come and ſpeake comfortably unto them.</p>
                  <p>I can give you two eminent inſtances both of mine owne knowledge:<note place="margin">Inſtance.</note> The one was when I was a little one; A rich man was walking, and there comes a poor Creature to him with death in his face, and begges of him ſome reliefe: the man was an hard man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; the poor wretch importunes, and through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity prevailes thus farre; ſaith the rich man, come to my houſe to morrow, and I will give you ſomething: Oh! ſir, ſaith the poore one, I ſhall die before morning, if I have not ſomething to ſuccour me this night; yet could not the Rich man be then prevailed with: that very night the begger dyed, &amp; was ſound dead the next morning: the Rich man laies this to hear (as I confeſs well he might) &amp; was ſo terrified, that for much time not the leaſt comfort could be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on him, but never was any guilt or ſinne like his;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115802:105"/> by night he was faine to have conſtant company, and Candles burning with him, and it would frequently cry out, That now the Devill was ready to ſeize on him: He was through providence brought unto a godly Miniſter where I was, and to whom I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; I being little was left in the roome, when the Miniſter and he were together, Oh! it would have broken any heart that had the leaſt of tenderneſſe, to ſee the poore man, what paines he tooke to load him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with miſery, and to obſtruct the way of mercy; and this was the upſhot of all, never was there ſuch a Murtherer as he, that obtained mercy. I remember (for the afflicted mans carriage made the diſcourſe take more impreſſion on me) the Miniſter inſtanced in <hi>Davids</hi> Murther, and aggravated it, <hi>what a man</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>was,</hi> of what <hi>profeſſion,</hi> under <hi>what mercies,</hi> &amp;c. and what a man <hi>Uriah was,</hi> a godly man, a faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a publique ſpirited man, &amp;c. and what a murther it was: <hi>known, wilfull, deviſed, plotted, longed for,</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> to <hi>David</hi> when accompliſhed; and yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, would not that poore man bee perſwaded, but that his ſinne was farre greater then <hi>Davids,</hi> and ſo ſuch as God would not pardon, although at length it pleaſed God by that Miniſter, to faſten ſome comfort on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Inſtance.</note>The other was mine owne experience, alſo not long ſince. Indeed the good woman deſired me for Caution unto others (concealing her) to take ſome occaſion to ſpeake of the thing. Her great ſinne, for which ſhee thought there was no mercy, no pardon was a lie; and on this manner ſhe was private at duty in a roome that was ſaid to be haunted (as the phraſe is) in the night, and there came by the Chamber doore, a man of the houſe that hearing ſome ſtirring there, asked her (it being very dark) whether ſhe was there or no, calling her by her name, ſhe being unwilling that hee ſhould know that ſhe uſed to be there, of the ſuddaine anſwered, that it was not ſhe; he urged her again and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115802:105"/> again, ſhe denyed: At length the man halfe affrighted, prayed her, as ever ſhe look'd for mercy from God, that ſhe would tell him if it were ſhe, and ſhee being much moved, and yet unwilling (through the ſtrength of the preſent temptation) to unſay what ſhe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, denyed it yet again. I thus farre agreed with her, that it was indeed a very great ſinne, and deeply to be ſorrowed for; but her language was, that it was the greateſt ſinne that ever was committed, and that there could be no mercy for her, becauſe ſhe had denyed the mercies of the Lord. I inſtanced in <hi>Peters denial</hi> of Chriſt <hi>once, twice, thrice,</hi> till it came to curſing and ſwearing, and perfect diſowning of his Saviour, <hi>I know not the man;</hi> I aggravated it from <hi>Peters</hi> ſolemne profeſſion of Chriſt, his engagement not to deny him, &amp;c. and yet notwithſtanding he obtained mercy. But for all I could ſay, I could not for the preſent perſwade the woman, but that her denyall was a farre greater ſinne then <hi>Peters;</hi> and though ſhe believed that there was mercy for him, and ſalvation for him, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claredly denyed his Saviour; yet could I not perſwade her, that there was any mercy for her, who as ſhee thought, had more perfectly denyed mercy: Yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the woman to be a good woman, ſomething of refreſhment ſhe had e're ſhe went away. This is the of ſinne, a bewildring darkneſs to ſuch a ſoule: ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate your ſinnes as much as you will, onely by their aggravation take heed of diminiſhing the <hi>freeneſs</hi> or <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Soules in ſuch a caſe,<note place="margin">

Is this thine argument? truly then thou muſt alſo ſay, that there was a time when <hi>Paul</hi> was a Reprobate (that ſpake it) for there was a time when Chriſt was not in <hi>Paul:</hi> Yea, that the Saints that are in heaven were once Reprobates; for certaine it is, that they were once Chriſtleſs: and if this be ſo, then to be Reprobate is no more then to unconverted; and if this be thy meaning, why ſhould'ſt thou deſpaire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thoughts that thou art a Reprobate? for though thou be Chriſtleſs, and by ſuch reaſoning a Reprobate to day, as <hi>Paul</hi> before Converſion, yet maiſt thou bee ſaved as well as he, and ſo reprobation ſhall no more hinder thy ſalvation, then unconverſion. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the dark deſpaire, that reſts upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto whom I ſpeake, that conclude they cannot be ſaved, becauſe (as they thinke) they are Reprobates, that they are not ſo criticall as to diſtinguiſh betwixt Reprobate as oppoſed to Elect, and oppoſite to Gods preſent approbation, which an Elect (but unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) perſon may not have: but take Reprobate in the ſaddeſt ſence, in which I cannot apprehend how any with reaſon, can make unconverſion an aſſuring token of it: onely glad they are (poor ſouls) to take up any ſtaffe wherewith to beat themſelves. I ſhall therefore in a word, tell you what I think from theſe two Scriptures that I have mentioned.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:115802:107"/>1. That ſouls that have Chriſt and are converted, may from thence be ſure that they are elected: but yet that it doth not hence follow, that ſouls that are yet Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and unconverted as yet, are reprobated. But yet</p>
                  <p>Againe, (ſo much I preſume the ſecond Scripture ſpeaks) that no ſoul can come to ſay, I am not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, I know I am not, but by being able to ſay, Chriſt is in me: although another ſoule may not ſay, becauſe Chriſt is not in me, therefore I am a Reprobate: Chriſt is in me, therefore I am no Reprobate, that Scripture concludes undoubtedly true Chriſt is not in me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am a Reprobate, that Scripture concludes not, neither can it ſo conclude, for it is a lie: ſinners in hell may ſay, we are all Reprobates, therefore Chriſt is not in us: ſinners upon Earth may not ſay, Chriſt is not in us, therefore we are all Reprobates; for though Chriſt be not in you to day, who can, or dare ſay, but that God may convert you to morrow?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall illuſtrate the whole of this,<note place="margin">2. Simile.</note> by a ſimilitude obvious to you. You have in your Town an hundred ſhifts by a Benefactors will, to be dealt forth to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poor men and women, whom the Truſtees ſhall chooſe out of all the poor. They are choſen before the Dole, which is to be at twice, and in two ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome to be diſtributed in the fore-noon, at one place of concourſe; ſome in the after-noon at another: the man or woman that receives in the forenoon, may reſt aſſured, that he or ſhe was elected or choſen, becauſe they have received; but he that ſtands by and receives not, cannot reſt aſſured, or be ſure, that he is not elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe although he receives not then, yet he may in the afternoon. Sinners that are timouſly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be ſure they were elected, becauſe they have <hi>received the gift of God:</hi> But ſinners that are yet uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I grant, they have abundant reaſon to queſtion, whether they be elected or no, and a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fear, leſt God ſhould call them Reprobate ſilver, but they cannot be ſure, they may not conclude that
<pb facs="tcp:115802:108"/> they are Reprobate, becauſe God may at the <hi>eleventh hour ſend them into the Vineyard.</hi> Though hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not in the forenoon, may fear he is not choſen; yet he may not conclude, ſo as to neglect to wait in the afternoon, it may be he may then receive. Unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones have reaſon to fear, that they are unelected ones: and let this to purpoſe humble them, but let them not ſo wretchedly conclude as to deſpair, and ſo as to neglect the <hi>afternoones dole:</hi> yea, ſurely they ſhould be the more <hi>humbly ſolicitous,</hi> becauſe there is but one part of the day to deal in, and if that be over, and Chriſt <hi>the gift of God</hi> not received, they may then conclude they were reprobated; but whilſt they are yet on this ſide Hell, let them return to God, for who knows, <hi>but God may return to them, and leave a bleſſing behind him,</hi> Jon. 3.9: So then my concluſion is, that whatever thy Converſation hath been, it is not for thee to conclude (if now thine heart be in any meaſure inclined towards God) that thou art a Reprobate, onely let prophane and impenitent ones know, that I ſpeak to poor diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſciences this day.

Now this is alſo a ſoul-bewildring darkneſſe; for if it be onely what Chriſt hath given, then it is onely what Chriſt hath done, that can be a propitiation to God for us. What, will God ever be friends with me, that give him nothing, nor do any thing for him? how ſhall I think that? Verily fleſh and blood wil hardly think it, therefore as the former queſtion was, <hi>Wherewithall ſhall I come before God?</hi> what ſhall I give? and the anſwer from God comes, <hi>without money, and without price:</hi> ſo the next queſtion that dark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prompts, is this; <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may inherite eternal life?</hi> Mat. 9 16. What good thing ſhall I do? Oh! we think it muſt be ſome good thing of our own doing, that muſt be at the bottom of our ſalvation. What good thing? ſaith Chriſt, keep the Law, and fulfill the Goſpel, &amp; that perfectly, for that's the ſum of Chriſts anſwer to him. Now friend, if thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extend ſo far, then go on to meet the Lord in thine own way. But now thou that liveſt upon ſuch terms, if ever God take thee, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> took <hi>Shimei,</hi> when he had gone beyond his limits from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Gath,</hi> after his run-away ſervants, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.39, 40.) The Lord will deal with thee, if ever he find thine heart running after the world, or after ſin, as he dealt with <hi>Shimei,</hi> ver. 44. God will call thee to a ſevere account upon every old ſcore, and return all thy wickedneſs upon thine own head, judging thee by thine own mouth. Think of the Phariſee, who comes and tells God what he hath done for God, &amp;c. <hi>Lu.</hi> 18.12. And yet went away <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,</hi> v. 14.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115802:115"/> of her Beloved,</hi> where art thou poore Soul? <hi>come unto me, and I will give thee reſt:</hi> And this abundantly revives her; yea, but by and by Chriſt comes and <hi>manifeſts himſelf unto her,</hi> and receives her, making her able by Faith to embrace him: <hi>He puts (his Robes) his Righteouſneſſe</hi> upon her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; his Oyle (his Comforts) into her wounds; his Wine (his Joyes) revive her; his Grace (his Oyntments) doe perfume her: and now the heart that was rent, and <hi>the bones which were broken doe rejoice</hi> with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. And now the ſoul makes too much haſte home, even greater than Chriſt ſeeth convenient for it, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Oh that I were diſſolved, that I might be at home with the Lord! Lord, now lettest thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> Oh! that I had but power according to my minde, what would not I doe for God? This is much haſte, but doth this hold alwaies?

It is not yet ſo free from the Wilderneſſe but it can againe heare the roaring Lyons, that is, 'tis again afflicted, perplexed, troubled: Satan's as loud, Conſcience is as loud as ever: And now ſaith the ſoul, <hi>alaſs! all was but a dreame,</hi> but a deluſion, and I was never at all brought out of the Wilderneſſe, never ſavingly wrought upon.

                  <p>I have been the longer,<note place="margin">Made out in the Spouſe.</note> becauſe I have been telling the main of the ſtory of this Spouſe in the Canticles unto that verſe which is my Text.</p>
                  <p>You may obſerve mention of two eminent times of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or benighting times to the poor Spouſe;<note place="margin">Twice in the dark.</note> the firſt was <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. <hi>By night I ſought him,</hi> &amp;c. Being in the dark ſhe was afraid to be any more without him. The ſecond was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. when ſhe fell aſleep, and Chriſt waited to awaken her, till <hi>his locks were bedewed with the night,</hi> ſaith the Text. Now in both theſe darkneſſes ſhe was at a loſſe for her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I ſought him, but I found him not.</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 2: ſo alſo <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. <hi>I ſought him, but he had withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> Here it ſeemes ſhe had once found him, but now ſhe hath loſt him.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuitable to this double loſſe,<note place="margin">Twice coming out of the Wilderneſs.</note> and benighted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you have mention made twice of her coming out of the Wilderneſſe. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. ſhe is bewildred and benighted, and at a loſſe for Chriſt, but <hi>ver.</hi> 4. at length ſhe gets at him; and it followes <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Who is this that comes out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe perfumed with all the precious powders of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant?</hi> Where you have to obſerve, 1. How ſadly ſhee was bewildred till ſhe came at Jeſus Chriſt. 2. In how glorious and tranſcendent beauty ſhe was, when ſhe, by taking hold upon Chriſt (as is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) came out of the Wilderneſſe. Oh 'tis ſuch a bright day now, that ſhe doth not thinke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother night, ſo much <hi>peace of conſcience &amp; joy in believing,</hi> ſo much raviſhment, ſuch ſmoking perfumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>ſhe comes out of the wilderneſs, and ſhe is a perfumed Spouſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then again, as you read of her ſecond Night, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bewildring in the fifth Chapter, ſo of her <hi>comming out of the wilderneſſe</hi> the ſecond time in our Text. Onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the difference, and you ſhall find it what I ſaid true: <hi>Who is this that comes up from the wilderneſſe, leaning upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115802:116"/> her beloved,</hi> Cant. 8.5. Oh! it was a long time this laſt bout, ere ſhe could finde that which ſhe had loſt in a nights ſteep of ſloth and ſecurity. At firſt, you ſee her <hi>at a loſs,</hi> chap. 3.1. and <hi>coming out of the wilderneſs,</hi> ver. 6. But now you muſt read from Chap. 5. to Chap. 8. before you heare of her <hi>coming up from the wilderneſs:</hi> At <hi>firſt ſhe comes up in full ſenſe of her glory;</hi> ſhe is a <hi>perfumed Spouſe.</hi> Next bout <hi>ſhe comes up in full ſenſe of her infirmity;</hi> ſhe is now a <hi>leaning Spouſe.</hi> Th re was more ſparkling, flaming, ſmoaking, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of joy before; but more ſerious, ſober, ſetled humility and dependance now. Before ſhe was more proud of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and leſſe aſhamed of her ſelfe: But now how glad in her Saviour, and yet how ſad in her ſelf. Yea, herein her heart (although ſhe <hi>lean, and come up from the wilderneſs</hi>) is ready ſtill to faile; becauſe after ſhe had taſted of his love, ſhe fell aſleep: And although ſhe were out of the <hi>firſt Wilderneſs (viz.</hi> that of the ſtate of Condemnation) yet fell into the <hi>ſecond Wilderneſs,</hi> even that drowſineſſe of ſpirit after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Therefore let not any poor heart among you (for whoſe ſake I have ſpoken all this) ſay, that it was never truly brought out of ſin, becauſe it is now, or hath been upon the wrack of new terrours, becauſe of its after-converſion, drowſineſſe, or ſecurity: Onely if ever thou be (as no doubt thou wilt be) brought out of the Wilderneſſe the ſecond time, covet rather to come out a <hi>leaning Spouſe,</hi> than a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed Spouſe.</hi> I mean, rather deſire to be kept low, and in <hi>dependance by Grace,</hi> than to be raiſed <hi>over-high by comfort.</hi> Thus much of the firſt bewildring darkneſſe after Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the enjoyment of our comforts. <hi>I would not let him goe,</hi> chap. 3.4. (That's her language at her coming firſt out of the Wilderneſſe, and 'tis <hi>pretty high and confident</hi>) but chap. 8.1, 2. <hi>O that thou wert as my Brother, I would lead thee, and bring thee,</hi> &amp;c. (this is her Dialect at her ſecond coming up from the ſecond Wilderneſs) <hi>here's more humility and dependance.</hi>

Surely ſaith the ſoul, I have been but deluded in ſpirituals, to think that God would <hi>ſave my ſoule,</hi> for in naturals I am at a great ſtraight, and God doth not provide <hi>for my body.</hi> If he <hi>loved me,</hi> he would never keep me <hi>ſo low,</hi> he would never <hi>ſo afflict me.</hi> Now this is <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> for ſaith Divinitie, If he ſhould not afflict thee, ſurely he doth not love thee. Such a darke cloud of providence in <hi>Jobs outward Eſtate,</hi> makes him <hi>at a loſs</hi> for his <hi>inward hope.</hi> Hear his language, <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.8. <hi>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot paſſe, he hath ſet darkneſſe in my paths:</hi> that's the darkneſſe that I now ſpeak of, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.

                     <hi>There is no true Light differing in the whole kind, or contradictory to another true Light.</hi> There may be a <hi>true Light,</hi> yet <hi>leſſer</hi> than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in this reſpect, <hi>there is one glory of the Sun, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Moon, another of the Starres,</hi> yet are they all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115802:125"/> true Lights; but then they are not contrary, but ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate the one unto the other. Thus the light of a Candle and the light of the Noon-ſun b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th are true lights; for though the Sun's doe ſwallow up the Candle's light (as it were) yet you ſee the Candle hath its light ſtill. But now take a Glow-worm, or a Scale of a Fiſh, or a peece of rotten wood, theſe ſhine in the darke alſo, but they are falſe Lights; for bring them to the Candle, or to the Sun, and there is nothing like light in them, they differ from it in the whole kinde. Thus the <hi>light of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>light of the Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>light of Grace,</hi> and the <hi>light of Glory,</hi> are <hi>different</hi> Lights, or <hi>diſtinct,</hi> one ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the other, but <hi>not</hi> in the leaſt <hi>contrary.</hi> But bring an Errour to the Light of the Word, and it is (like a peece of rotten wood brought unto a Candle) very darkneſſe, ceaſing altogether to be a Light. So then what ever Doctrine it is, that is contrary to any knowne true Light, reſolve upon it, that that is a falſe Light.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, take this <hi>threefold Rule;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rules.</note> for there is a <hi>threefold known Light.</hi> So then whatever Doctrine runs counter, either firſt <hi>to the light of Nature,</hi> or ſecondly <hi>to the light of the Spirit,</hi> or thirdly <hi>to the truth as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> cannot be a true Light.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then,<note place="margin">1. The light of Nature, that is, ſo far as men goe along with the Bible without a Bible.</note> there is an undoubted impreſſe of Eternall Verity upon our natures, ſome ſparkes whereof yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after our ruines of Nature in the fall, which nothing in all the Scripture is, or can be contrary unto, becauſe it is a true Light as far as it goeth, and for the quality of it. This you read of in the Heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. I ſay not, that by improvement of that, they might have demerited a ſaving meaſure of true light, but ſo much they had, that by the uſing of it, they might have avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that groſſe Idolatrous darkneſſe, that he there ſpeaks of; for this is flatly contradictory to the light of natural reaſon, <hi>that that which was made by me</hi> (ſuppoſe an Idol) <hi>ſhould be my Maker.</hi> I remember once in <hi>Ireland,</hi> one went about to diſſwade the ſouldiers from oppoſing the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115802:126"/> Rebels; for, ſaid he, <hi>If one ſmite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other;</hi> and this he called a <hi>Scripture-ſelf Reſignation,</hi> miſtaking that ſcripture, and oppoſing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> written indelebly in all hearts. I have alſo read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> of two men that ſolicited two young Virgins (made their Proſelytes) to Fornication; the Maids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the motion with diſdaine, telling them, that their natural modeſty and ſhame abhorred it; they replyed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently, and importunately, and it ſeemes too prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that that was <hi>ſelf,</hi> and to be <hi>denyed,</hi> elſe <hi>no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now that could not be a true light, becauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſcience it ſelfe did abhominate it. In ſuch caſes we may ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.14. <hi>Doth not even Nature it ſelf teach you?</hi>

                  <p>So here, the Scriptures (as before) are the undoubted writings of the holy Spirit.<note place="margin">Sum of the Scriptures.</note> The plaine tendency of theſe is clearer then the Sunne. viz. <hi>That ſalvation is from God onely through Chriſt, and according to the Election of grace unto man-kinde once happy, now loſt, by that lively faith which carryeth perſeverant obedience in its boſome, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, that God may be all in all.</hi> This, <hi>who ſo runs</hi> through the ſcriptures <hi>may read,</hi> and ſuch a ſcope you have called the <hi>Analogy of Faith.</hi> Now then if there be any ſingle ſentence that ſeems to divide from the whole, either you muſt deny the ſcriptures to be the Holy Spirits, (which is blaſphemous, &amp; who ſo comes that, firſt let him ſeek ſatisfaction of whom he will, I ſtudy not to ſatisfie him) or if you yeeld them to be of divine inſpiration, you muſt ſuppoſe (that though you be ignorant, or your reaſon in the dark, which may well be) that yet there is a ſence of it that you diſcover not, that bears a ſweet harmony with the whole; and ſome worthy men have ſweetly ſtudyed out much <hi>exquiſite Muſick</hi> in theſe <hi>ſeeming diſcords,</hi> which they have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by collations of ſcripture with ſcripture: and if a ſence be diſcovered (though latent as to the letter, or firſt view, &amp;c.) that may competently fall in with the preſent intended diſcourſe, and accord with the whole frame of the ſcriptures, we cannot be at ſuch a blind confuſion, as was ſuppoſed in the Objection; that you may ſay, this is your ſence, that is mine; and why may not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115802:127"/> I be as right as you? Thou haſt one ſence of a ſcripture, and another hath another: thou thinkeſt that thine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation unties all the knots of that ſcripture, and his thou thinkſt doth not: but now friend, if thy ſence be contrary to the undoubted principles of truth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the tendency of the ſcriptures, though thou be not ſure that the other mans ſence (ſuppoſed to accord with the rule of faith) is the very ſence of this very place, becauſe he cannot by it reſolve all thy difficulties; yet may he be ſure that thy ſence is falſe, as to this ſcripture in particular, becauſe it will not ſtand with the ſence of ſcriptures in the generall; for every ſpark is Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of the ſame kind with the whole flame.</p>

You would have ſmall cauſe to thank any man, that ſhould lead you into the way of the valleyes, when your way is the way of the hills, and life and death depends on the diſpatch of your journey.

Oh! how difficult to get up the hil of Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? what pains muſt I take to get to Communion with God in the ſpirit? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The way of Repentance is an up-hil way.<note place="margin">1. The way of repentance is an up hil way.</note> This is the language of the repentant Prodigal, <hi>Lu.</hi> 15.18. I will <hi>ariſe, and go to my father:</hi> without getting up, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done as to repentance. Sin is <hi>aſleepe,</hi> it is a <hi>death at the bottom of the hill,</hi> and there is no repentance without an awaking, an ariſing, a getting up to the top of the Hil. Thinke with your ſelves, and remember you that have been acquainted with repentance, whether mortification for ſinne, mortification of ſinne, dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by the Law, and dying unto it by the Goſpel, were an hard or an eaſie matter, an up-hill or an down-hill way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith is an up-hil way. Have you not heard <hi>of the fath of Abraham?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.

                     <note place="margin">3. Of obedience.</note>Thirdly, Goſpel-obedience is an up-hil way. Its hard to get a great weight up an hill; therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſſeth Goſpel-obedience, he bids us <hi>lay aſide the weight, that we may runne with patience,</hi> Heb. 12.1. The old <hi>Adam</hi> is a clog to our obedience, and weights eaſily pull us down, and if down, to riſe againe, it is up-hil work; ſuch is obedience. Gods call for our obedience, is like his command to <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 32.49, 50. <hi>Go up to Mount</hi> Nebo, <hi>and dye there.</hi> So, <hi>go up</hi> into thy Cloſet, and <hi>kill thy Corruptions, let thy deareſt luſts dye there, pluck out thy right eye there, and cut off thy right hand there.</hi> I had as live dye, (ſaith a ſtubborn ſpirit) as do ſuch a thing, and ſuch verily is our natural ſtubbornneſs againſt God. When God bids us up &amp; do this, or that, fleſh and blood had as live dye as do it. When the Goſpel bids thee look about all things, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Lands, Houſes, Life; and Leave, Forſake, Hate them all, and then thou ſhalt be a Diſciple unto Goſpel-obedience: Is not this every whit as much, as <hi>go up to Mount</hi> Nebo, <hi>and dye there?</hi> ſurely he never yet found this way, that hath not found it to be an up-hil way.</p>

Of Goſpell converſe in ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>Fourthly, The way of Goſpel-Communion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, with Chriſt, with Saints, in the Spirit, in an Ordinance: My Brethren, is not this an up-hil way? Is it not this that makes your hearts ſweat againe, to get up, or keep up your Spirits duly in this way? Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>went up into a Mountaine to pray,</hi> and unleſſe thou canſt <hi>come up into the Mountaine,</hi> thou wilt very hardly <hi>come to pray.</hi> The Spouſe looked for Chriſt in the high-wayes; that is, (as I ſaid before) the Ordinances; but ſhe had not looked yet high enough for to find him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5. <hi>The King is held in the Galleries.</hi> If thou be as the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>In the ſecret places of the ſtayrs:</hi> I am come to meet thee this day, to tell thee that the King is <hi>above in the Galleries;</hi> his voyce then to thee is this, <hi>Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> for I, ſaith Chriſt, do not uſe to come down lower, the King is held in the Galleries; that is, If you be in

I judge it may refer hither, that we read of the <hi>Mountains of Prayer, the Mountaine of Holineſs, the Mountaine of Praiſe,</hi> typing that the way of Goſpel-Communion is an Up-hil way.</p>

The terme from which is ſo low.</note> and it it is <hi>ſo low</hi> a ſcituation, that you cannot poſſibly <hi>come out</hi> of it, but you muſt <hi>come up</hi> out of it. Paradice was a lofty ſtate, and as it were a lower Heaven, but in the day that <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt out of it, he went to inhabite ſo <hi>low a ſoyle,</hi> ſinne I meane, that it is ſaid of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Its ſteps take hold of Hell</hi> If the ſinner were but <hi>one ſtep lower,</hi> he would be <hi>in Hell.</hi> Nay, what if I ſhould ſay, that the <hi>wilderneſs of ſinne,</hi> is in a ſort as <hi>low as Hell:</hi> nay, in a ſort, an <hi>Hell, Pſal.</hi> 86.13. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoule from the loweſt Hell.</hi> Sinne is <hi>an hell,</hi> but I can't ſay it is the loweſt Hell; the <hi>loweſt hell</hi> is <hi>the ſecond death.</hi> If thou be in the ſtate of ſinne, thou art in Hell already; underſtand it ſoberly. <hi>He that beleeves not, is condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18. <hi>Damned already:</hi> onely the Grave-ſtone is not yet rowled unto the mouth of this Grave, the <hi>gulfe</hi> is not yet fixed, the way is yet open, and poor ſoules may come out by beleeving.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; The term <hi>unto which</hi> ſoules move,<note place="margin">2. The terme unto which it is ſo high.</note> when they come from the Wilderneſſe of ſinne, ſpeakes it to be an up-hil way.

                        <p>If your foot ſlip, you doe not get nearer to grace by it, but more back again into the wilderneſſe:</p>

If thou get nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſinne, as thou doſt undoubtedly, then ſinne undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is the down-hil way, for <hi>we ſlip not up the hill, but down; we fall not upward, but down-ward:</hi> Now this Circumſtance is clear in ſcripture, in experience, and where not? and it is convictive hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the way from the Wilderneſſe of ſinne, is up-hil; for upon any ſlip our ſoules ſlip to ſinne, ſo that the Lord inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cryes out, <hi>Returne ô backſlyding Children, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 3.22. &amp;c. All the wayes of ſinne are <hi>backſlyding wayes,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are <hi>down-hil wayes;</hi> and therefore the way from the Wilderneſſe, is to <hi>come up.</hi> Thus much for proof, and ſurely of this mind was <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he ſaid, that <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from hell beneath,</hi> Prov. 15.24. Whether you reſpect the <hi>hell of ſin,</hi> or <hi>of ſuffering for ſinne,</hi> which are both beneath: but the way of life, whether of <hi>holineſſe</hi> or <hi>happineſſe,</hi> is above to the wiſe, that is an <hi>Up-hil way.</hi>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115802:134"/> and the duties of holineſſe alone, is to reſolve to dwell in the Wilderneſſe yet ſtill, for that is the <hi>valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> and theſe are the <hi>Up-hil wayes.</hi> Come up, come up, from the wilderneſs you idle hearts, that love to walke onely in the way of the plaines. Oh! but ſay you, I have tryed to come out, but I have made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, I can eaſily go in farther and farther; but why can I not as eaſily go out? no wonder at all, going in to it is <hi>down-hil,</hi> comming out of it is <hi>up-hil;</hi> therefore never think of coming out of it, unleſs thou take as much, nay more paines to get out of ſinne, then ever thou didſt in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And by the way,<note place="margin">2. That take paines to goe farther into it.</note> let me further challenge poor wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of very madneſſe, that in ſtead of taking paines to come up from the Wilderneſſe, take (as ſome do) much paines to go farther down into it: Alas, poor ſoules, 'tis down-hil way, thou art likely to be at the bottome ſoon enough (even in the <hi>loweſt hell</hi>) without running down: and if any take paines this way, how ſhall this condemne thoſe that take no paines the other way?</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Look not down-ward, look down and faint, and ſo fall down.

                  <p>The Spouſe in the Text had been in the Wilderneſſe,

Of God the Father.</note> even <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, Son, and holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the great deſigne of God the Father, that poor ſoules ſhould come up from this ſpiritual wilderneſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9, 10. <hi>Jacob is his portion, he found him in the Wilderneſſe, and led him about, and inſtructed him; you</hi> have this explain'd, or (if you wil) ſeconded; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God,</hi> Ezek. 34.11. <hi>I, even I will both ſearch my ſheep, and ſeeke them out. They have been ſcattered in the cloudy and darke day,</hi> v. 12. (Of this we have ſpoken) <hi>I will feed them in a good paſture, on the high Mountaines, there ſhall their fold be, &amp;c.</hi> verſes 13.14. (Of this we ſpake in the laſt diſcourſe) <hi>I will ſeeke that which was loſt, and will bring again that which was driven away. I, even I,</hi> ſaith God. My friends, ſhall the Lord God make it his owne great buſineſſe to ſeeke thy loſt ſoule, and ſhall it not be thine? the Lord forbid. I would have thee know, if thy ſoule be loſt, and God ſeek it, and thou doe not thy ſelfe ſeeke it;<note place="margin">And thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a deſpight to him.</note> if thou doe not cooperate, thou offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt deſpight unto the Lord God. When God looks for loſt ſoules, and they would not be found, but the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thine heart is as <hi>Ahabs</hi> to the Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. <hi>Haſt thou found me O mine enemy?</hi> Poor ſoules
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115802:136"/> count God their enemy, when his Word or Spirit comes ſo near them, as to find them: why this is to offer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight unto God, yea, then when he is offering the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mercy conceivable, yea more then can be conceived unto thee. Thou art <hi>ſcattered,</hi> God would <hi>gather thee;</hi> thou art <hi>loſt,</hi> but God would <hi>find</hi> thee; this is his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> under which it ſhould quite be ruined, <hi>Lu.</hi> 13.34. <hi>He would, but they would not.</hi> If a child ſhould loſe it ſelfe, and the father finding it, ſhould offer to bring it home againe, and the child ſhould wrangle, and refuſe his offer; what would you call this? or what would you account the child worthy of? Gods goodneſs is a <hi>leading goodneſſe,</hi> and if thou refuſe to be led by it, thou ſhalt be accounted a <hi>deſpiſer</hi> of it, ſo ſaith the Holy Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the great buſineſſe of God the Sonne. We have had occaſion to ſhew that,<note place="margin">2. This the great buſineſs of God the Sonne.</note> though Chriſt were <hi>never bewildred,</hi> yet was he <hi>led into the Wilderneſs,</hi> that he might learn to <hi>looke after loſt ſoules.</hi> This he profeſſeth to be his buſineſſe, <hi>Lu</hi> 19.10. <hi>I came to ſeeke, and to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> This was the errand (as you have heard) that the Father ſent the Sonne into the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and this he purſues, as a light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and a guide into the way of peace, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1.79. And now ſhall it be the buſineſſe of the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">And thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a deſpite to him alſo.</note> to ſeek thy loſt ſoule, and ſhall it not be thine own? Why? <hi>Thou offereſt deſpight to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When Chriſt tenders himſelfe as a <hi>new and living way,</hi> and ſoules notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reſolve to be loſt ſtill, this the Apoſtle aggravates by them that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 10.28. and calls it a <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding under foot of the Son of God,</hi> v. 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the buſineſſe of the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">3. It is the great buſineſs of God the holy Spirit. 1. By our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</note> to bring poor ſoules out of the wilderneſſe of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By our Miniſtry: the Holy Ghoſt is at the charge of ſending forth guides furniſhed with Gifts for the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the loſt, and all that expence is hereunto: this therefore the Lord ſorely challengeth, and ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115802:137"/> them for, that were called Shepheards, that <hi>they ſought not that which was loſt,</hi> Ezek. 34.4. <hi>And his ſheepe were ſcattered; yet none did ſearch, or ſeek after them,</hi> verſ. 6.<note place="margin">Deſpite done to Meſſengers herein, is done to him that ſent them.</note> 
                     <hi>And truly in purſuance of this meſſage, whatever deſpite you offer unto any meſſenger, you offer it</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>unto him that ſent him;</hi> that is, <hi>the Spirit. He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> Luk. 10.16. And ſhall the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace employ ſo many Miniſters to call thee from the Lyons Den, &amp;c. to look after thy loſt ſoule? and doſt thou not make it thine own work? Oh! what deſpite is this unto him that ſent them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. By his own.</note>Secondly, By his own Miniſtry, by the miniſtration of himſelfe, his light, his grace, his guidance, <hi>Io.</hi> 16.13. <hi>The ſpirit of truth ſhal guide you.</hi> The great buſineſs of God the Holy Ghoſt, is to be a guid to poor ſoules; and ſhall it be his work, and wilt thou have no care of thine own loſt ſoule? this is to <hi>do deſpight</hi> flatly <hi>to the Spirit of grace.</hi> So ſaith himſelfe,<note place="margin">And to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this, is to do deſpite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit of grace.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Conſider, conſider; it coſt <hi>God the Father</hi> the loſſe as it were (for a time) of his own <hi>Sonne</hi> out of his <hi>own boſome,</hi> to help loſt ſoules. It coſt <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> the loſſe of his <hi>own</hi> precious <hi>blood</hi> out of his <hi>own heart,</hi> and <hi>veynes,</hi> to redeem loſt ſoules. It coſt the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> the <hi>ſhedding abroad</hi> of <hi>his</hi> gifts and graces, the ſending forth of multitudes of meſſengers to ſeek poor loſt ſoules; and wilt not thou make it thy great buſineſſe alſo? Wilt not thou be at any coſt or charges to accompliſh it? if thou wilt not, at once, thou doſt diſpight (not onely unto me, or any others, as poor meſſengers, but alſo) unto all <hi>the three,</hi> that are <hi>one God.

                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let your occaſions lye this way. If a mans occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions lye an up-hil way, it matters not much how high the hil be: he muſt go that way, his occaſions lie there, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.24. <hi>In her occaſion, who can turn her?</hi> When your occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are for <hi>London,</hi> though it be up to <hi>London,</hi> yet you wil goe, and who can turne you?

                  <p>Secondly, Accuſtom thy heart this way. Its little to him to go up to <hi>London</hi> every week,<note place="margin">2ly.

                  <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour the proof of the point. 1. By taking from under you, your other ſupports. 2. By roling your ſoules, with mine own, upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And 1. For Negative proofe of the point, by way of removal of other leaning ſtocks.<note place="margin">1. Negative. By removal of other leaning ſtocks.</note> I may ſay in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all other ſupports, what is ſaid of the Hypocrites, <hi>His hope ſhall be cut off, and his truſt ſhall be a ſpiders wed; He ſhall lean his upon houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand; he ſhall hold it faſt, but it ſhall not indure,</hi> Job. 8.14, 15. A poore houſe, you will ſay, that falls if the Owner of it doe but leane unto it; ſuch are all Chriſtleſs ſupports to the loſt ſoule. 'Tis recorded of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> That having no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (for his Name and Memorial to reſt upon) he built him a Pillar, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.18. that was before that he had, (or elſe when he had buryed) the Sonnes ſpoken of, <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.27. Let thoſe ſoules that never have heard of a Chriſt to reſt upon, make Pillars for themſelves of other things: But as one living <hi>Son</hi> would be better then a thouſand <hi>dead Pillars,</hi> ſo is one <hi>living Saviour</hi> of (infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely) more value then 10000 <hi>dead ſupports</hi> for thy poor ſoule to leane upon.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeake particularly to theſe nine, the onely like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaning ſtocks,<note place="margin">Particularly theſe nine.</note> none of which ſhall without a Chriſt, ſtand thee in ſtead when thou leaneſt upon them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If thy leaning ſtock be thine old acquaintance, with God as Creator,<note place="margin">1. Leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as Creator.</note> 'tis as nothing (if it goe alone) in order to ſalvation; many poor creatures have this, and no more to lean to. <hi>VVhat do you think God that made me, will damn me?</hi> yes truly, I doe thinke ſo, if thou have no more to ſay for thy ſelfe; for if this were enough to ſalvation, none, no not Devils, ſhould be damned. It is not <hi>old acquaintance,</hi> as a <hi>Creature;</hi> but <hi>new acquaintance,</hi> as a <hi>new Creature,</hi> that is ſpoken of <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. and that is, (as ſaith the Apoſtle, by being in Chriſt.) As for any others, <hi>The Lord that made them, will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour,</hi> Iſai. 27.11. It would be <hi>ſad believing,</hi> if poor

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2ly. Leaning upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God.</note> If thy leaning ſtock be onely ſome latter acquaintance with God in his outward providence. And believe it, with very many this goes very far. <hi>What, do you think that God that hath given me ſuch proſperity, will in the end damn me? I have a faire portion of outward things, ſhall all this love end in eternall hatred? Nay, when I was in great ſtreights, God gave me great deliverances; when I was at deaths door in ſuch a ſickneſs, &amp;c. and do you thinke he will now caſt me into hell?</hi> Verily for ought I know he may, and if thou have no more to lean unto, I know he will. You have an eminent paſſage, a providence to a miracle, yea to heaps of miracles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.23. <hi>He opened the door of heaven, gave them Corn of heaven,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>Angels food,</hi> meat <hi>to the full,</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>He rained fleſh as duſt,</hi> and feathered <hi>foul, as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore,</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>He gave them their own deſire,</hi> verſ. 29. <hi>Yet while the meat was in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the fatteſt of them,</hi> verſes 30.31. Mark, Firſt, <hi>Whilſt it was in their mouthes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The fatteſt of them.</hi> Ah! friends, many times, <hi>fair paſture</hi> is a <hi>foul ſign;</hi> You, your ſelves, litter and fodder thoſe Cattel <hi>beſt,</hi> that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the ſlaughter <hi>ſooneſt.</hi> Go to therefore rich men, lament and howl, and let your joy be <hi>turned into weeping, if you have nothing but this worlds good to lean unto,</hi> as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods love for the preſent, or your owne ſalvation for the future.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Civility be thy leaning ſtock.<note place="margin">3ly. Leaning upon Civility.</note> Of this I ſpake before (as a way) and therefore ſhall onely ſet a brand of it here, that you may know it againe to be a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Pillar, an houſe with a ſandy foundation, if you lean unto it, will not ſtand. All <hi>theſe have I done from my youth,</hi> Mat. 19.20. ſaith the civil young man, yet went a way with a ſad heart, for all he had his Crurch of civility, (and riches to boote) to lean upon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4ly. Leaning upon religious duty.</note> If thy leaning be upon thy religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes (of this alſo, as ſome mens way before.) This (ſirs)

Nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps eminent diſpencers of the Goſpel to others, yet come themſelves to be <hi>caſt away.</hi> My beloved, I tremble to think what ſingular adventures they were engaged in, what ſignal ſucceſſe they had, how confidently they leaned hereunto, how miſerably their Pillar ſhrunk from under them, when they leaned upon it, and eaſily gave way to their going downe into hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that day,</hi> (marke, 'tis not a rare inſtance, this is a common leaning ſtock) <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> (there is confidence) <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy name?</hi> (there is the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>and in thy name have caſt out Devils?</hi> (there is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) <hi>and in thy name done many wonderfull works,</hi> (there is the quantity of the adventures, and quality of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.)

Nay, my friends, there may be ſomething done in good earneſt by way of Reformation, that is not yet to be leaned unto: Some <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado Drunkard</hi> may ſay perhaps, <hi>As long as I haunted Ale-houſes, I could have no peace of conſcience, but now I have left thoſe courſes, &amp; grown civil, I can walk very quietly &amp; calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> this is well that thou haſt left off the practice of ſins, that did once enſnare thee; but if thou ſtay here, or lean hereon, all is nothing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 44. <hi>The houſe was empty,</hi> and <hi>ſwept,</hi> and <hi>garniſhed,</hi> (that is, it was voyded of ſinne, reformed, and now had ſome garniſh of civility, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, or the like;) but becauſe it was emptied of the former uncleane ſpirit, and not filled with Chriſts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>the firſt,</hi> in time <hi>returns.</hi> v. 45. <hi>and takes with him ſeven ſpirits worſe then himſelfe, and they enter, and dwell there,</hi> and <hi>the laſt eſtate is worſe then the beginning:</hi> verily, this may well be called a <hi>repentance to be repented of.</hi> The poor man thinks, if his bad tenant ſuch a corruption were out, it's no matter for getting Chriſt in; <hi>But godly ſorrow worketh repentance, never to be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. There are, it ſhould ſeem, repentances to be repented of; and undoubtedly of this ſort, is every repentance that you reſt in, or lean upon.</p>

                     <note place="margin">8ly. Leaning upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes without Chriſt.</note>Eighthly, If you lean upon the promiſes of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not upon Jeſus Chriſt in them; this will alſo come to nothing: Whence is it that you ſhall have ſo many ſoules bringing a promiſe to the throne of grace, and carrying ſo little away from it? I feare it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from hence, becauſe they leane unto promiſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaning to Chriſt in the promiſe. Thus you ſhall find the Jews in ſcripture, to leane much upon the promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who when Chriſt came that was the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> him they rejected altogether. Thus many would willingly owne the promiſes, that will not leane upon Jeſus Chriſt. But what ſaith the Spirit? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>All
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115802:143"/> the promiſes of God in Chriſt are yea, and in him, Amen:</hi> That is, the <hi>aſſurance, ſtability, certainty</hi> of them <hi>all</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in leaning upon Jeſus Chriſt; He is the <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of them. Now what a vanity would it be for a man to put a Paper in ſute, which hath neither <hi>yea</hi> nor <hi>amen</hi> to it, neither <hi>hand</hi> nor <hi>ſeal</hi> to it? Sir, might he ſay to any man, <hi>Theſe are your Articles, you know you wrote them: wrote them,</hi> ſaith the other: <hi>but who ſubſcribed them? who ſealed them?</hi> the Hand and Seal are the confirmation of the Bond, which without them, let it relate never ſo much, is worth nothing in Law, no wiſe man will leane to it, ſo vaine a thing is it to put any one promiſe into ſute at the throne of Grace (becauſe all the promiſes in Chriſt are Yea, and in him onely Amen) without leaning upon Chriſt in them: for indeed they ſay nothing, what ever they ſay, there is neither Yea, nor Amen in them; there's nothing <hi>affirmed</hi> to thee in them, nothing <hi>confirmed;</hi> neither hand nor ſeal to theſe Bonds, if thou have not Chriſt; therefore, <hi>thou haſt no part nor portion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Yea,<note place="margin">9ly. Leaning upon God himſelfe out of Chriſt.</note> though you ſhould leane upon the God of promiſe, without leaning upon Chriſt in whom he hath promiſed, the Lord would reprove thee for making choice of himſelfe, as an abſolute God for thy Leaning-ſtock. You have ſome ſeverely threatned by the Lord, that are yet ſaid willingly to <hi>lean upon the Lord,</hi> Mich. 3.11. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling ſinners</hi> to himſelfe, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt ſoules, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Woe to them that come to him, not <hi>bringing this his</hi> Benjamin <hi>along with them.</hi> Lean not immediately, I mean without the Sonne, but by the Sonne upon the Father: for (as the Lord hath limited himſelfe by his owne purpoſe and word of truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>it is impoſſible for God to lye.</hi>) God can do nothing for a poor loſt ſoule, without Jeſus Chriſt; therefore (to ſpeake with all reverence and holy ſobriety) to come to God without Chriſt for ſpiritual helpe or ſupport, is to come to <hi>one that cannot helpe you,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:115802:144"/> and <hi>ſaid he will not;</hi> and it is uncomfortable lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where we are forbidden to expect reliefe. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it may be in great concernments, as needful for us to have intereſts in a great perſons Secretary or Officer of his Seal, or his Lord privy Signet, or Maſter of Requeſts as to have favour from the Prince himſelfe, becauſe his Law and way, whereunto he in forraigne freedome, hath bound himſelf, is to diſpatch ſuch things by ſuch officers, and by his Seal which is in his Officers keeping, and not to diſpatch them otherwiſe; ſo that if one be ſuppoſed to come to ſuch a King, and ſue for the accompliſhment of ſuch a buſineſs, and do not bring the Officer with him, by which the King wil onely tranſact it, the King would put him off, and ſay, <hi>My Lord Keeper</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is not in the way, and nothing can be done without him.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is the Lord Commiſsioner, and ſole Commiſsioner of the broad ſeale of Heaven, the onely Maſter of Requeſts unto the great King of Glory;</hi> come then with as much confidence of Gods favour, (as thoſe in <hi>Micah</hi>) even as it is poſſible for any Chriſtleſſe ſoule to have, the Lord will utterly reject thy ſute, and turn thee backe, until thou look out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to come with thee unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and thus much Chriſt himſelfe hath told thee, <hi>No man comes to the Father but by me,</hi> Joh. 14.6. But why ſpeake I thus mildly herein? Sirs, ſhould you bring your <hi>Chriſtleſſe ſoules,</hi> and caſt them upon the Throne of <hi>an abſolute God</hi> for a <hi>reſting place, having</hi> not <hi>made the Kings Chamberlain firſt your friend,</hi> (as they did in the <hi>Acts</hi> 12.20.) without making the <hi>Angel of his preſence,</hi> the Lord Chriſt your friend: behold, Divine juſtice would immediately ſpie you out, and as ſoon cry out, Behold a REBELL in the Court, and ſo apprehend you, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deliver you to the Tormenter for ever; thus it was with them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.11. <hi>They will</hi> (by all means) <hi>lean upon the Lord;</hi> and yet this God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. expreſly declares, that <hi>he will plough them up,</hi> and make <hi>them to become heapes.</hi> Now friends, if <hi>God himſelfe will not be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115802:144"/> leaned upon out of Chriſt, what then ſhall poor Chriſtleſſe Creatures dare to leane unto?</hi> And thus much for removal of other leaning ſtocks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2ly. Poſitive proofe, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Chriſt as the only leaning ſtock.</note> I come now to aſſert and propoſe Jeſus Chriſt as the onely ſtay and ſtable ſupport for loſt ſoules to leane upon. And that upon this cleare and familiar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. If you leane to any man in the world, <hi>what is it that perſwades you to lean to him for any thing? to lean at all, or to him, rather then to any other?</hi> Why? theſe are the two, and onely two grounds. 1. <hi>His word of promiſe.</hi> 2. <hi>His power of performance.</hi> It were vaine to truſt to a poor man that is not worth a groat, who it may be oweth thee a thouſand pounds, &amp; hath often promiſed it to thee, when he was able, but the man is now begger'd and thou knoweſt his beggery, to truſt, I ſay, upon this money, and leane to to his payment, becauſe <hi>there wants power of performance,</hi> though there want not promiſe. And it were a greater vanity for thee, to go to a rich man that is worth 40000 l. and leane upon him for a thouſand pounds that never promiſed thee, or ſaid that he would give thee ſo much as a farthing of it, becauſe though he be able to performe what thou deſireſt, <hi>there lacks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> But now when a man hath ſaid, and engaged that he will give thee ſo much, and he is able to give it thee, and thou knoweſt him to be an honeſt man, this thou maiſt leane to, thou reckoneſt this as good as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in thy Purſe, thou buildeſt upon it, and truſteſt to it.</p>
                  <p>Now upon this account, I undertake to prove that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is immediately to be taken hold upon, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto by loſt ſoules, becauſe he is alone. 1. The <hi>word of God.</hi> 2. The <hi>arme of God.</hi> He is the <hi>promiſe.</hi> He is the <hi>power of performance.</hi> He is Gods <hi>truth,</hi> and Gods <hi>ſtrength</hi> Now whatever ſoule ſhall lean elſe-where, (yea though it be on God himſelfe, out of Jeſus Chriſt) leanes where there is no promiſe. 2. Where there is no power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

                     </label> I durſt adventure to anſwer this Queſtion by asking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Amongſt you, (let me ask you) Who are they that need, that care for a ſtay, a leaning ſtock, a crutch, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a couch, a bed, or any thing proper to be leaned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?<note place="margin">The weake and the wearie.</note> you'l ſay, <hi>the weake</hi> are for leaning, and <hi>the weary</hi> are for reſt. The ſtrong and the freſh, what care they for a leaning ſtock? But to the weake and weary, it is precious; and indeed the more weake and weary they are, the more precious it is unto them. I obſerve the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſcope of that excellent experimental and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Book of the Preacher, Is the conviction and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the weakneſſe and wearyingneſſe of all that is here below, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I have ſeen all the works that are under the Sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Vanity, there's their <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>impotency</hi> to helpe us: and vexation of ſpirit, there's their <hi>wearyſomneſſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, for that which is vexing to the Spirit, is tyring and tedious to the Spirit. Now this is the preaching of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and unleſſe you be under the power of it in this point, it will be vaine to preſſe you to leane upon the Lord Jeſus, although a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> be here; but who ſo believeth that Text in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> will readily cloſe with this Text in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> But as for Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that can feed without feare on the feaſt of their own cooking; and Worldlings that can battle themſelves in their ſinnes, is it not ſtrange that they are too ſtrong and too luſty, too freſh and too lively, to leane on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: ſo then, 'tis onely weake and weary ones, that either will, or can ſavingly leane upon the Lord Chriſt. I crave leave to be full both in proving and preſſing this practical truth.</p>

                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:115802:146"/>1. Loſt ſoules that will be leaning ſoules,<note place="margin">1. Weak ſouls may be lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoules, and onely they.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God would never have engaged the ſtrength of Chriſt hereunto, if any ſtrength of ours, or any others on this ſide Chriſt would have ſerved the turn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As long as a ſoul hath ſtrength on this ſide Chriſt, it will not care for leaning for ſtrength upon Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, is at firſt laid out for this very end, to weaken our ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt will never give in of his ſtrength, until he hath weakened ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, This Propoſition I ſhall lay down,<note place="margin">1. Ieſus Chriſt had not laid out his ſtrength upon loſt ſouls, if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength would have ſerved the turne.</note> That if our ſtrength might have ſerved to the ſaving of our loſt ſouls, the Lord would never have laid the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt out unto ſuch an end. Friends, you may not think, that that God who is ſo loath that your blood ſhould be loſt, would be prodigal of the blood of his owne deare Sonne, ſurely he would never have ſuffered Jeſus Chriſt to have dyed in vaine: Now therefore it was that Chriſt loved not his life unto the death, that as by his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we might be healed, as by his poverty we might be made rich, ſo by his weakning through the fleſh, we might be <hi>ſtrengthened with all might by his Spirit in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man:</hi> which if all things elſe had not been too weak to have accompliſhed, Jeſus Chriſt would not at ſo deare a rate have effected it. If any thing might have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to our bewildred ſoules beſides <hi>Jeſus,</hi> it muſt have been <hi>Moſes;</hi> I meane <hi>performances, ſervices, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law.</hi> Our ſtrength in the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was by <hi>doing,</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> 'tis by believing; Now if that firſt Covenant could have ſtood loſt ſoules in ſtead unto ſalvation, Jeſus Chriſt had not been engaged, but in this the Apoſtle is expreſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſent his own Sonne in the likeneſſe of ſinful fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> If
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115802:147"/> any thing could be our ſtrength on this ſide Chriſt, it muſt be the Law. But the Law cannot, being weake through the fleſh, that is, our carnal hearts and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: therefore God ſent his own Son. Now if Chriſt were ſent in default of other ſtrength, into the world for loſt ſoules, I hence conclude; that any ſoule that expects ſalvation by leaning upon Chriſt, muſt lye under weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to any and every other ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2ly. There are none but weak ſoules that will be leaning ſouls.</note>Secondly, There are none but weak ſouls that will be leaning ſoules, becauſe there is no ſoule that hath ſtrength of its owne, that will care for the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt. This you have eminently obſervable in the ſtory of <hi>the woman with the bloody iſſue;</hi> as long as ſhe had either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in her Purſe, or Phyſitian to go to, ſhe never comes to Jeſus Chriſt: that is, As long as there were any other courſe to be taken, if ſecurity will do it, or formality, or any other meanes may be uſed, our hearts naturally abhor comming to Jeſus Chriſt. But when all was gone, money out of her Purſe, and hope out of her heart, &amp;c. then <hi>ſhe comes to Chriſt to take hold on the hemme of his Garment,</hi> and (as ſmall a meaſure of leaning as that was) it reſtored her <hi>ſtrength unto her,</hi> Luk. 8.43, 44. You ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſay, That <hi>you are not weak enough to lye by it, though you be ſcarce well enough to ſit up:</hi> So, though foules halfe-convicted, are ſcarce well enough to live without Chriſt, yet are there but few of them weake enough to lye by it; that is, to leane upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the buſineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, to weaken, as wel as to ſtrengthen ſouls.<note place="margin">3ly. Chriſt will take away thy ſtrength before he will beſtow his own.</note> 
                     <hi>To weaken the ſtrong, as well as to ſtrengthen the weake:</hi> and therefore no ſoule can be a leaning ſoule, till it be a weake ſoule; for Chriſt will weaken it, as to its own ſtrength, before he ſtrengthen it with his owne. What <hi>David</hi> complains of in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.23. <hi>That God had weakened his ſtrength in the way,</hi> the ſame muſt thou ſay in thy ſoules experience, for Chriſt weakens whomſoever he ſtrengtheneth. Thus <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. He takes a courſe to make them out of love
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115802:147"/> with their own riches, &amp;c. and then <hi>counſels them to buy</hi> of him. And truly (my friends) Chriſt hath as hard worke of the one, almoſt as of the other; and our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his Goſpel, is to weaken your ſtrength, as well as to ſtrengthen your weakneſſe. Haſt thou any ſelfe-ſtrength? if Chriſt love thee he will never leave thee, till he hath weakened thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are ſpiritual, mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> God will pull down what is ſtrong in thee, before ever he build up what is weak in thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God hath choſen the weake things of this World, to confound what is mighty,</hi> weak preaching to confound mighty corruptions and ſtrong luſts. If you build a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> ſtrong holds of your owne of one ſort or another, the Lord Chriſt will bring them to naught, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them: Whether thou be <hi>ſtrong in thine own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or mighty in thine own righteouſneſs,</hi> he wil weaken thy ſtrength in the way: therefore unleſſe thou be weake, there's no leaning upon him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is the way and method,<note place="margin">4ly. In thy weakneſſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his owne ſtrength:</note> and onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Lord Jeſus, to give in ſtrength unto thoſe that are made thus weak. Hear Chriſts voyce, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Paul.</hi> And hear the anſwer of <hi>Pauls</hi> experience, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>For when I am weake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>then am I ſtrong.</hi> Yea, this is the conſtant experience of all that receive ſtrength in the way of Faith; that is, leaning upon Chriſt. When the Apoſtle had ſpoken of ſo many believers, and thought of more, that the time would faile to reckon them up, and what they did by faith, this he inſerts in the cloſe of all <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34.<note place="margin">A double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. 1. Wouldſt thou have thine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, thou muſt become a fool.</note> 
                     <hi>That out of weakeneſſe they were made ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this in a double inſtance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wouldſt thou have ſtrength into thine underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by leaning unto Chriſt for ſtrength, truly thou muſt goe in all manner of ſenſe of the weakneſſe of thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to the Throne of Grace, and complaine of

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">2ly. Wouldſt have thy whole ſoule ſtrong? thou muſt be ſenſible of thy weakneſs, in will, affections, &amp;c.</note>2. If thou wouldſt by leaning upon Chriſt, derive any ſtrength into thy will or affections, thou muſt goe in the ſenſe of thine infirmity, <hi>viz. That thou art not ſufficient of thy ſelfe ſo much as to thinke any thing that is good;</hi> that thou haſt from thy ſelfe, neither <hi>to will, nor to doe;</hi> thou muſt come complaining as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>When I would do good, evill is preſent with me.</hi> 21. Nay, that thy will to good is but weake, and thy will to corruption ſtrong, ſo that <hi>the law of thy members doth</hi> not onely <hi>warre,</hi> but <hi>take thee captive to the Law of ſinne,</hi> as he complaines, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and cryes out upon it, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am!</hi> ver. 24.

Is it ſo that none can leane upon Chriſt, unleſſe they be as thou art? here then is abundant matter of rejoycing and reviving to thee, where thou thoughteſt there was nothing but ſadneſſe, even ſorrowing unto death. There have ſundry ſoules come ſad unto me upon this account, and this was the great burthen of their complaint. Oh! I am ſo weake in prayer, of ſuch a weake judgement, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern, or ſo weake a memory, that I cannot retaine the things of God; and ſurely it can never be well with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115802:148"/> me, and truly mine heart hath often leapt within me, for joy to behold this their ſweet ſorrow: theſe poor ones do not find others complaining ſo much of weakneſſe, and therefore they thinke that every one is indeed ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they. Now to ſuch let me ſpeake, even to thoſe amongſt you, whoſe ſtrong holds the weapons of our warfare have been pulling down, and whoſe ſtrength the Lord hath weakened, that if there be any cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing unto any ſoule on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt, it is barely, and onely our being made weake by Chriſt, or our tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſenſe and feeling of our weakneſſe out of him: and herein verily we may boaſt, ſo farre as our weakneſſe gives an <hi>objective advantage</hi> unto the glorifying of the ſtrength of the Lord: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>I will glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me; yea, I take pleaſure in my weakneſſes, for when I am weake,</hi> then <hi>am I ſtrong.</hi> Methinks, I am ſent this day with that meſſage unto ſuch ſoules that I meet with, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Strengthen you the weake hands, and confirme the feeble knees: Say unto them be ſtrong,</hi> ver. 4.

So there are ſome, that are <hi>ever complaining</hi> of their weakneſſes, as to the things of God, which <hi>are never able</hi> (becauſe not truly willing) to grow ſtronger, or to come up to any ſtrength of grace.

                  </p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, The weakneſſe muſt be <hi>univerſall weakneſs,</hi> as they that have <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35. <hi>Neither eye to ſee, nor ear to heare, nor tongue to ſpeak, nor feet to walk,</hi> verſes 5.6. All this is

                     <note place="margin">2ly.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3ly. As to the intenſiveneſſe, it muſt be burthenſome. 1. So thy weakneſſe.</note>Thirdly, Thy <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>wearineſs</hi> muſt be <hi>burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> as to the <hi>intenſiveneſs</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thy weakneſſe muſt be <hi>burthenſome.</hi> Many there are that are <hi>weak in duty,</hi> and <hi>weak in grace,</hi> (if ſo be they have enough to denominate them weak in it) and that ſee it too, and yet are not burthened with it. This is not the load that lyes upon their ſpirits; but an <hi>Habakkuk trembles, his lips quiver,</hi> and <hi>his heart faints</hi> at it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. And <hi>the Lord God ſhall be his ſtrength,</hi> ver. 18. A <hi>Paul</hi> will cry out of it, <hi>O wretched man!</hi> and who <hi>ſhall deliver me?</hi> and 'tis a <hi>body of death, q. d.</hi> It could not be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter burthen to me to have a <hi>dead body</hi> fixed to me to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about me, then to carry about this <hi>dead heart,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115802:154"/> And then he can <hi>thanke God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 7.24.25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2ly. So thy wearineſſe.</note> Thy wearineſſe muſt be burthenſome wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, never be thou well till thou be rid of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laiden.</hi> Many are weary, that are not greatly burthened with their wearineſſe: but <hi>Aſaph</hi> was ſo loaden, that he was even <hi>over-whelmed</hi> again, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 77.3.</p>
                  <p>Now if thy ſoule be thus burthened with thy ſpiritual either weakneſſe or wearineſſe,<note place="margin">And if it be ſo,</note> thou maiſt thus diſcover it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.

Nay, there is not a Goſpel Sermon you heare, but in ſome ſort or other, ſuch a tender is made unto you, and how few do then account their infirmities their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yea, you will be glad at heart, but to change <hi>burthens</hi> with one that hath a <hi>lighter</hi> and <hi>eaſier</hi> then yours: Why ſuch is Chriſts, (if you be truly weak and wearied) <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen light.</hi> Thy ſoule will think it an happy exchange, to paſſe from <hi>Satans plough,</hi> to the <hi>Lords plough;</hi> when once thou feeleſt the weight of Satans <hi>Chayne,</hi> thou wilt eſteeme the greateſt of the Lords Commandements, or thy duties, as a <hi>chaine of gold</hi> to hang about thy neck. <hi>Every neck would be willing to be ſo burthened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all that hath been ſpoken,<note place="margin">A Concluſion from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent truth, that no ſoule comes home to God in the ſtrength of its own legges.</note> to me it is eaſily to be concluded, that there is no loſt ſoul that ever yet was, or ever ſhall be brought home unto God by the ſtrength of its own leggs: I ſhall therefore conclude the ſtate of theſe qualifications, according to the expreſſe doctrin of <hi>Lu.</hi> 15.5: The ſhepheard <hi>laies the loſt ſheep on his ſhoulders rejoycing;</hi> that is, he takes the loſt ſheep off its own leggs,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115802:155"/> and we read of its <hi>carrying,</hi> before its <hi>curing,</hi> (as of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals comming,</hi> before his cloathing) that relates to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particle (as I may ſo ſay) of converſion. Firſt; God <hi>acts when we act not,</hi> I meane in the firſt moment (I doe not meane of the time, but) of the work: next, that <hi>acting of God makes us act</hi> together, as to time. <hi>Chriſt carryeth</hi> (in the firſt parable) and <hi>we come</hi> (in the next) Arminians deny the one, Antinomians the other: I aſſert both. In that <hi>primely-prime act</hi> (as I may call it) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth not cut off our legs,</hi> but yet <hi>he doth not uſe them,</hi> for <hi>he layeth us upon his ſhoulders.</hi> And who can conceive, if there be any portion of the <hi>converſion-act,</hi> wherein that may be truly ſaid, that in ſuch an act the <hi>ſheep uſeth its own leggs, when it is carryed upon the ſhepheards ſhoulders?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this doth genuinely fall in with what I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>univerſal weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>wearineſſe,</hi> that muſt burthen us, before we have advantage from the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt. This ſheepe had neither <hi>legge</hi> to <hi>ſtand on,</hi> or to <hi>go with,</hi> (though it had all its legges ſtill) for if it had, it would undoubtedly have had <hi>legs to run away with;</hi> and ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſhould cure us, whileſt we lie weak and weary upon the ground, and ſo ſet us upon our own legges, (which bleſſed be God ſhall never be) and not bind us to his owne ſhoulders, (or bring us as the Spouſe to leane upon him) by an union indiſſoluble; I need no argument, but ſad experience to convince mine owne baſe heart, that I ſhould quickly uſe (or abuſe rather) my cured legges, and the rene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it is not their <hi>old ſtrength</hi> that they move by, but Chriſt's put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Chriſt gives them his Wine to refreſh them, and

                  <p>COme we now to the third Queſtion,<note place="margin">3d. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon Chriſt is? Anſwer in four Conſiderations 1. Of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. viz. the Beloved. And how Chriſt came to be the ſtrength of the weak, and the ſtay of the weary.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. What the leaning of a weak and weary ſoule upon Chriſt for ſtrength and refreſhment is?</hi> In anſwer whereunto, theſe foure Things fall under our inſpection. The <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Originall,</hi> or <hi>ſpring of the act;</hi> the <hi>Notion,</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the <hi>Object.</hi> The Texts tells you, it is [the Beloved, that is, Chriſt] But how? or in what reſpect is Chriſt? or how comes Chriſt to be the ſtrength of the <hi>weak,</hi> and the ſtay of the <hi>weary bewildred ſoule?</hi> ſurely it is not Chriſt, <hi>any how conſidered,</hi> that is thus the ſoules ſupport, and therefore Chriſt is not <hi>confuſedly</hi> to be <hi>leaned upon:</hi> but Chriſt ſo, and ſo conſidered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and therefore there are diſtinct Notions under, or in the which he is to be leaned unto. Now the enquiry after theſe, falls neceſſary, and I hope uſefully under this head. For as it is not <hi>fleſh</hi> that ſtrengtheneth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>ſimgly conſidered,</hi> but fleſh thus, and thus wholeſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dreſt,</hi> and <hi>prepared,</hi> whence that in the 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou prepareſt a Table for me:</hi> The Lord as it were, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to dreſſe his meat for him; eſpecially you know, <hi>that fleſh muſt be well cook'd;</hi> that is <hi>to ſtrengthen the weake,</hi> that is prepared for the <hi>ſick:</hi> And as it is not a Bed that will give refreſhment to a <hi>ſick</hi> and weary one, but a Bed thus, and thus <hi>prepared, well made;</hi> whence that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.3. <hi>The Lord will make all his bed in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> Mean worke, you'l ſay, for the <hi>great God</hi> to <hi>dreſſe our meat,</hi> and <hi>make our beds,</hi> yet ſuch as he pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115802:170"/> in, <hi>becauſe he delighteth in mercy:</hi> So I ſay, It is not barely the Lord Chriſt, but Chriſt (as I may ſay with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) thus, and thus dreſt, that is the <hi>ſtrength of the weak;</hi> and Chriſt thus, and <hi>thus prepared,</hi> that is thereſt &amp; <hi>refreſhment of the weary.</hi> Take Chriſts owne account of this matter, <hi>Io.</hi> 3.14. As <hi>Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up;</hi> Marke, <hi>[muſt be].</hi> It was not enough that he was incarnate, and <hi>made fleſh,</hi> that he was the Sonne of man; but being <hi>made fleſh,</hi> there is a neceſſity of his <hi>being dreſt,</hi> and <hi>made ready</hi> for the <hi>food</hi> of ſoules. The <hi>Braſſe</hi> did not cure them, unleſſe it were <hi>thus and thus prepared;</hi> it muſt be made in <hi>figure of a Serpent.</hi> Neither did this <hi>Serpent</hi> cure them, but it muſt be <hi>lifted up,</hi> ſo Chriſt muſt <hi>be lifted up:</hi> And this one word ſpeakes Gods whole mind, as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Lord Chriſt,<note place="margin">How Chriſt was prepared hereunto.</note> to be the ſtrength and the ſtay of loſt ſoules; for this one word hath a double <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi> as Chriſt had a <hi>double lifting up.</hi> 1. He was <hi>lifted up</hi> to his <hi>Croſſe,</hi> ſo prepared for the <hi>ſouls ſupport</hi> in his ſtate of <hi>Humiliation.</hi> 2. He was <hi>lifted up</hi> to his <hi>Crown,</hi> and ſo prepared by his ſtate of <hi>Exaltation:</hi> and upon ſuch account it is that Chriſts <hi>ſalvation for loſt ſouls,</hi> is called a <hi>prepared ſalvation,</hi> Luk. 2.30, 31. <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation which thou haſt prepared.</hi> Unto each of theſe I muſt therefore ſpeak a few words.</p>
                  <p>And 1. As to the <hi>eſtate</hi> of our Lord Chriſts <hi>Humiliation,</hi> obſerve with me four Things.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That hereby he became an <hi>apt and ſutable ſupport</hi> for the <hi>weak</hi> and the <hi>weary</hi> to lean upon. And therefore</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They may herein have <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> and <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to leane upon him.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Bodily wearineſſe</hi> upon occaſion of bodily labour, Chriſt was as ſoon tyred therewith as another man (of his conſtitution, (&amp;c.) would have been, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Jeſus

Now ſhall we dare to blame God for keeping <hi>open houſe,</hi> (that is, inviting all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord knowes all will not come upon his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or that all <hi>cannot?</hi> Why? yet he knowes that they that <hi>cannot will not;</hi> and who can (yet) <hi>have them excuſed?</hi> they may complement it with an <hi>I cannot come,</hi> and it is true too, but God knows their meaning is, <hi>they will not come.</hi> Sometimes your Great Men keepe open Houſe, invite all commers, and all that doe come are welcome, but all cannot come; becauſe of this, what foole will think that their magnificence is counterfeit and not ſerious? Yet dare blaſphemers ſay, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you muſt grant that <hi>all</hi> have <hi>power</hi> and <hi>free-will</hi> to come, or elſe God is <hi>not ſerious</hi> in inviting all: doth not Scripture ſay, <hi>He would have all men to be ſaved?</hi> Why, think a little, ſuppoſe ſuch a Noble Man ſhould ſay to his Steward, I am willing that all the poore of the Towne ſhould be relieved, and all ſtrangers entertained, and therefore diſcourage none from comming, but bid as many as come welcome: and his Steward ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, My Lord, <hi>You know ſuch and ſuch cannot come, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome think themſelves as well at home, others do not love your Lordſhip, and will not come; but, and if you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded that they ſhould All come, you would make them come, you have power enough, &amp;c. Never talk of inviting All, your Lordſhip is not ſerious in what you ſay, and your Hoſpitality is but a piece of abſurdity:</hi> Affront inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, offer now ſuch [language] to thy <hi>Governour, and will he be pleaſed with thee.</hi> Mal. 1.8. Pray, how comes
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115802:180"/> that Lord to be bound, to make them to accept that which he was never bound ſo much as to offer. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, how comes God to be ſo farre in mans debt, as to be bound to make <hi>all come,</hi> elſe he muſt be charged (as not ſerious) in <hi>inviting All;</hi> ſince the reall tenders of grace <hi>unto All,</hi> are of MERE MERCY, but the making of any to accept thoſe <hi>tenders</hi> (who once had freewill and full power to chooſe the good, but have wilfully loſt it, and are now unwilling thereunto, till they be made willing) is (not a <hi>debt</hi> unto <hi>any,</hi> but) a MERE MIRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLE of MERCY to thoſe few that are <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> prepared unto that which is prepared for them.

                  <p>'Tis <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and onely <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Viz. Intereſt in Chriſt whom we lean upon.</note> that gives a right to this <hi>act of leaning</hi> upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This word I take up from my Text, with reſpect unto the wanton Chriſtians of the preſent <hi>Age.</hi> Oh! they make nothing of <hi>believing,</hi> and of rolling all their ſinnes (were they more then they are, which can ſcarce be) upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as I heard for certaine of a woman of a vile converſation, who was got into mounting Clouds of the <hi>Ranting Creed,</hi> when a Neighbour told her vainly, ſure Miſtreſſe,<note place="margin">A word to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Confidents or leaners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>ſuch a one Chriſt will have a very heavy load of your ſins,</hi> ſhe anſwered wickedly, <hi>Even let him take them, let him take them all, i'le never trouble my ſelfe with them:</hi> that was as to the guilt of them, for as for the Commiſſion of them, it appeared by her daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that that was too <hi>light</hi> a thing to trouble her.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, I would faine know, what ſuch wanton <hi>Confidents</hi> (for <hi>believers</hi> I know not how to call them) can ſay to what God hath expreſly ſaid to them? Why? will they ſay, Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh, and whoſoever comes, will he by no means caſt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115802:181"/> forth,</hi> and therefore you ſhall never diſſwade us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, or keep us from in-comming. Doe you aske us how we dare take ſuch hold of Chriſt,? why, have not your ſelfe ſaid, that he <hi>invites ſinners to take hold of his ſtrength,</hi> Iſai. 27.5. <hi>that they may have peace?</hi> 'Tis true friend, but ſtill upon his own terms, you muſt lay down your <hi>Bryers and Thornes;</hi> that is, <hi>your warring wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, you muſt forſake the one, if you will hold to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> But and if you reſolve as yet to hold your ſinnes, at leaſt wiſe if you doe not reſolve to lay them downe, (for,<note place="margin">God knocks off their fingers from leaning on Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Who will ſet them up, but he ſhall be burnt up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> with them?) know, that the <hi>Lord is ſo far from cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you to take hold,</hi> that he will even <hi>knock off your fingers from holding</hi> upon his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. <hi>But unto the wicked,</hi> God ſaith, <hi>what haſt thou to do, to take my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant into thy mouth?</hi> Unto what wicked ſaith God ſo? unto <hi>all</hi> that have been <hi>wicked? no,</hi> for he explaines it of thoſe that are reſolved to be wicked ſtill, verſ. 17.

'Tis certaine <hi>Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing,</hi> unleſſe he be thus applyed; and how ſhould he be applicable, but by being made thine?

Dareſt thou go a <hi>Whoring</hi> with Satan, and willingly a <hi>wantoning</hi> with the world all the day long, and then come <hi>in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and lean upon Chriſt at night?

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115802:182"/> &amp;c. That Chriſt came to ſave ſinners of whom I am chiefe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15.

                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks, I am fully convinced that I <hi>abſolutely</hi> need ſuch an <hi>Husband</hi> as Chriſt is, <hi>to pay my debts</hi> which are great: and as much need I have of ſuch an <hi>head</hi> to live with me, (as a <hi>man of knowledge</hi>) to <hi>reprove,</hi> to <hi>convince,</hi> to <hi>inſtruct me;</hi> and even as great need alſo of ſuch an head as I ſee Chriſt will be, <hi>to govern mine unruly Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> my <hi>heart,</hi> my <hi>thoughts,</hi> mine <hi>affections, &amp;c.</hi> Methinks, I ſee not in Chriſt <hi>any thing at all that I can ſpare,</hi> neither can I find <hi>any thing miſſing in Chriſt,</hi> that my ſoule can ſtand in need of: this is the voyce of that Aſſent which I am ſpeaking of. And this you have at large explained, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.21, 22, 23, 24. Where by way of promiſe, and propheſie, he ſpeakes of this very Aſſent, I have ſworne ſaith the Lord, <hi>That unto me every tongue ſhall ſweare,</hi> (23. verſe) <hi>And what ſhall they ſweare? That there is no God elſe beſide God, a juſt God, and a Saviour,</hi> and that unto him they look <hi>even for ſalvation</hi> by him onely, verſes 21. and 22. Yea, and <hi>ſurely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I ſtrength and righteouſneſſe,</hi> v. 24.

                  <p>Therefore let me aske your ſoules this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Were they ever fully, and ſatisfactorily perſwaded, that Jeſus Chriſt were <hi>onely,</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> ſuch an one, as you could unfeignedly make your Beloved?

                  <p n="1">1. Hinderance is this, That (though all loſt ſoules do need Chriſt, yet) there are very, very few, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend their loſt eſtate, and ſo perceive their <hi>need of

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115802:191"/> becauſe ſo few feele Chriſt; that is, there are few tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced and perſwaded, <hi>that with Chriſt is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and with none other. You have already heard of the Diſciple that leaned upon Chriſts boſome, and how expreſſeth he his experiences of Chriſt? 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.1. ſaith he, <hi>Our hands have handled the word of life.</hi> Oh! when the ſoul comes to feel <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a <hi>promiſe,</hi> (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> felt the <hi>Pillars</hi>) then will the ſoule cordially leane upon Jeſus Chriſt, and not tell then. Therefore it is no ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there are ſo few that leane upon Chriſt, becauſe you know they are a few indeed that come up to ſuch ſweet and ſoul-ſatisfying experiences of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>all men naturally,</hi> they want an <hi>hand to feele Chriſt;</hi> for a <hi>carnal hand</hi> cannot take hold of a <hi>ſpiritual object.</hi> Sirs, we are all born not <hi>Mephiboſheths,</hi> not <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa's</hi> onely; that is, <hi>lame of our feet,</hi> but <hi>lame of our hands</hi> alſo, ſo that whileſt we are onely naturall, we cannot <hi>take hold of eternal life,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The naturall man cannot receive the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> He cannot receive <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> becauſe he wants a <hi>ſpiritual hand,</hi> (for the force of the whole verſe lyes clearly in that) and that he wants a <hi>ſpiritual hand,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is no more then a <hi>naturall man.</hi> If Chriſt would be <hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi> he muſt be <hi>connaturallized</hi> with us. Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17. with Chap. 4.15. And if we would be able to <hi>feel ſpirituall things,</hi> we muſt (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Be ſpiritualized together with Chriſt;</hi> as he partook <hi>of our natures,</hi> to feel the <hi>things of our natures,</hi> ſo muſt we <hi>partake of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to feel the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>Memorable is that paſſage, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe, that</hi> I <hi>might reſt in the day of trouble.</hi> Here's ſtrange ſhaking, and as ſtrange eſtabliſhment, I <hi>trembled</hi> that I might reſt.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Though Chriſt come a wooing in <hi>Port deſpiſed</hi> by the <hi>World,</hi> on the <hi>Colt of an Aſſe,</hi> the <hi>fooliſhneſſe of preaching;</hi> yet is it not <hi>of conſtraint,</hi> but of <hi>condeſcenſion,</hi> and with a <hi>rich compenſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is, (let the world know) not of <hi>conſtraint,</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> that Chriſt comes in ſo <hi>mean a Port.</hi> He could if he would, come ſo as to convince you hereof; but it is <hi>of choice</hi> that he comes ſo meanly. I have read of one of the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> that having been long moleſted by the <hi>King of an eaſtern Country,</hi> having at length an <hi>Embaſſy</hi> ſent him by ſome contemptible <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> (yet the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt</hi> that that Country afforded) the Roman Emperour thinking it were in ſlight, asked them if their Maſter <hi>had none more Heroicall then they?</hi> they anſwering they were his <hi>Chieftains,</hi> he brake out in ſuch an immoderate laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he dyed in it. The <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of the World, thus deride the Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>him that ſent them,</hi> becauſe of the meanneſſe of the <hi>Meſſengers:</hi> But let them know, that as he <hi>laughed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to death,</hi> in <hi>laughing them to ſcorn,</hi> ſo may theſe laugh themſelves to <hi>damnation</hi> before they are aware: and as for us, Call they us, and count they us as they pleaſe,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115802:200"/> 
                     <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>croaking Calviniſts,</hi> and what they will; yet may not we anſwer that our Maſter hath none more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſend, or that he cannot come in greater <hi>Port:</hi> for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.9, 10. <hi>He bowed the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>came downe.</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe was under his feet:</hi> And <hi>he rode upon a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub,</hi> and <hi>did flie;</hi> yea, <hi>he did fly upon the wings of the wind,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.1. Behold, <hi>the Lord rideth upon a ſwift Cloud.</hi> And this might be his <hi>Port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So might Angels alſo be his Meſſengers, 1.7. <hi>Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Angels</hi> Spirits, and <hi>his Miniſters flaming fire.</hi> Chriſt could goe a wooing in a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> as the Lord came to anſwer <hi>Job,</hi> Iob. 38.1.

                        <p>The 5th. You muſt part with your limbs for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                        <p>But 1. Chriſt will never cut off any, but what's a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grening the whole body.</p>
                     </note>The fifth and laſt Terme is, If you will marry Chriſt,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115802:207"/> you muſt part with <hi>hand,</hi> or <hi>foot,</hi> or <hi>eye,</hi> &amp;c. for Chriſt, whereunto I ſhall ſpeak two words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt never deſired, or will deſire to have any Member from thee, but that which is <hi>rotten,</hi> and <hi>rotting:</hi> not unleſſe thy <hi>right eye,</hi> or <hi>hand,</hi> &amp;c. offend thee; that is, are ready to Gangrene the whole body. <hi>Immedicabile vulnus, Enſe recidendum eſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, If Chriſt call for the whole body, 'tis but that <hi>body of death</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Mortifie your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> Col. 3.4.

Or if for thy body in Martyrdom, 'tis but for thy <hi>vile body,</hi> and that in exchange for a <hi>glorious body,</hi> ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. And this leads me to the next. Therefore</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, If Chriſt have a <hi>limb,</hi> or a <hi>joynt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2ly, Chriſt wil give a new and living member in the room of it.</note> or an <hi>eye</hi> from thee; 'tis not that thou maiſt become <hi>lame,</hi> or a <hi>Cripple,</hi> a <hi>blind,</hi> or a <hi>maimed Spouſe;</hi> but that he may give thee better for them: the <hi>ſeeing Eye,</hi> the <hi>hearing Eare,</hi> the <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Feet,</hi> and the <hi>working hand,</hi> for the <hi>blind Eye,</hi> and <hi>deaf Eare,</hi> and <hi>lame Leg,</hi> and <hi>dead Hand,</hi> even the <hi>New man,</hi> for the <hi>Old,</hi> Col. 3.9, 10. <hi>Put off the old man,</hi> put <hi>on the new,</hi> the <hi>living</hi> for the <hi>dead,</hi> Rom. 6.13. If Chriſt cut off <hi>your luſt after the world,</hi> in the roome of it, you ſhall have <hi>love to God:</hi> If <hi>your covetouſneſſe after earthly things,</hi> 'tis that you may more <hi>earneſtly covet the beſt things:</hi> if your wilfull ignorant and <hi>Saul-like zeal,</hi> 'tis that he may give you in the room of it, a <hi>Paul-like zeal,</hi> and according unto knowledge. <hi>Love</hi> was in <hi>Magdalen</hi> a rotten <hi>limbe,</hi> and to be <hi>cut off</hi> by Converſion, Love was in <hi>Magdalen</hi> a <hi>living affection</hi> after converſion, and that which muſt remaine lovely in the eyes, and for the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all unto whom <hi>that Goſpel ſhall be preached.</hi> And now friends, goe home reſolved to take Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne termes.<note place="margin">4.

                  <p n="4">4ly, As to your diſſatisfaction in Chriſts wooing Carriages. Chriſt <hi>ſmites</hi> before he <hi>ſmiles;</hi> he will <hi>pierce,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115802:208"/> wound, ſtrike, bruiſe,</hi> yea, <hi>break the heart,</hi> that he comes to wooe, before he marry it. And yet for all this, muſt I ſay as the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let Chriſt ſmite me, and it ſhall be a kindneſſe.</hi> It was not through any unkindneſſe of the <hi>Father</hi> unto his <hi>only Son, That it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him,</hi> as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. For he was ever <hi>well pleaſed in him.</hi> No more maiſt thou impute it to unkindneſſe, that it pleaſeth the Son to <hi>bruiſe thee,</hi> for he intends everlaſtingly to <hi>take pleaſure in thee.</hi> I ſhall mind you but of three Things conſiderable,<note place="margin">Three ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and then refer it to your own Conſciences, to judge whether theſe be not <hi>kind, righteous,</hi> and <hi>deſirable ſmitings;</hi> though ſmitings ('tis confeſt) they are, <hi>viz.

                     <note place="margin">5ly, As to Chriſts eſtate.</note>THe fifth and laſt prejudice againſt Chriſt, is as to matter <hi>of Eſtate</hi> in foure Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he muſt have your portion out of hand.</hi> That you <hi>must take his word for your joynture.</hi> That you <hi>muſt go into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>To the firſt term, viz. You muſt truſt him with your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Conſider 'tis but what thou hadſt from him at firſt.</p>
                     </note> and <hi>die by the way,</hi> before you can be poſſeſſed of it, I come now to remove this prejudice.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt of theſe particulars, I have four things to ſay for thy ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though Chriſt require your portion ready downe to be put into his hand, and to be at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall; yet is it herein the more reaſonable in that you <hi>had it all from him, and from his Father</hi> at the firſt. It is not an ordinary match, when Chriſt the <hi>only Son,</hi> of the <hi>only Creator,</hi> goes a wooing to poor Creatures. 'Tis as if when the Father hath got an Eſtate under the Stewardſhip of ſome Noble Lord, or Prince, and that Princes Heire ſhould come a wooing to his <hi>Stewards Daughter:</hi> If hee require all her portion at his diſpoſe, 'tis but what came from his Father, ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I will take away my Corn,</hi> and <hi>my Wine,</hi> and <hi>recover my Wool, and my Flax, given to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115802:210"/> cover thy nakedneſſe.</hi> Mark that, <hi>Given to cover thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> yet my <hi>wool, &amp;c.</hi> ſtill. So Money is given to fill thy <hi>Cofer,</hi> yet is it the Lords ſtill: <hi>Meat</hi> is given to cover thy Table, yet is it the Lords ſtill: So that if Chriſt will have thy <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Corne,</hi> or <hi>Wool,</hi> to diſpoſe of to a poore <hi>Member</hi> of his now, and then, 'tis no more then <hi>his own,</hi> even what thou hadſt received of him firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, If Chriſt take any thing from thee, that is called tine, it is not with intention that thou <hi>ſhouldſt want it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2ly, He intends not that thou ſhouldeſt want it, whileſt he uſeth it.</note> or be a <hi>loſer by it;</hi> Chriſt will not aske thy Coat, <hi>that thy nakedneſſe may be ſeen,</hi> nor thy <hi>Meat</hi> from thee, to <hi>ſtarve thee.</hi> But if thou <hi>lend unto the Lord</hi> Chriſt, <hi>that which thou lendeſt, ſhall he pay thee again,</hi> as he did the <hi>Widdows meal</hi> and <hi>oyl</hi> in her <hi>Cruſe.</hi> You have the Spouſe inviting Chriſt unto her Garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake O North wind, and come thou South, and blow upon my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> that <hi>the ſpices thereof may flow forth: Let my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved come into his Garden, &amp; eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi> And you have him requiting her love, and returning her kindneſs with advantage, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I am come into my Garden, my Siſter, my Spouſe, I have gathered my Myrrhe with my ſpice, my Hony Comb with mine hony, my Milk with my Wine: Eat O friends, and drink abundantly, O beloved.</hi> This ſhe had (even this rich entertainment and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant welcome) becauſe ſhe had beene ſo free to Jeſus Chriſt. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. I <hi>will ſup with him</hi> (ſaith God, and what of that?) <hi>and he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> Sirs, Let me tell you (whatever the <hi>wiſdome of this world,</hi>

The uncertainty of what they have, and what they are, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids you to be certaine of it, but truſt Chriſt with it, and read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord,</hi> any <hi>do good,</hi> and verily <hi>thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> Lend to others, and conclude <hi>it may be,</hi> I ſhall be repaid againe: Lend to Chriſt, and

                     <note place="margin">3ly, He takes it to give thee better for it</note>3ly, If Chriſt <hi>take from thee any thing of thine, 'tis to give thee a better in the room of it.</hi> 'Tis as if an Husband ſhould ſay, Wife, <hi>Prethee give the poor woman at the door thy old and plain Garment,</hi> and ile give thee a <hi>new,</hi> a <hi>laſting,</hi> a richer <hi>Garment</hi> in the roome of it. Friends, what can we part with for Chriſt, but theſe momentany vaine things, that periſh in the uſage? and what we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Chriſt, are <hi>durable riches and ſubſtance,</hi> Mat. 19.21. <hi>Go and ſell all that thou hast, and give to the poor.</hi> Yea, but would fleſh and blood ſay, that is the way to want my ſelfe.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Two Farther Obſervations from the Text.</note>Which that I may with more advantage inquire into, I ſhall take up from my text, two farther <hi>previous Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> which I think are evidently lodg'd in the boſome of this expreſſion, <hi>Leaning on her Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>That as that ſoul that will have Chriſt for its beloved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. The ſoule that leans on Chriſt muſt have none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaning-ſtock.</note> 
                     <hi>muſt have but one beloved, even Chriſt: ſo that ſoul that will have Chriſt to lean upon, muſt have nothing elſe to lean upon beſide Chriſts:</hi> For as the Text mentions but one <hi>Spouſe,</hi> viz. The Church of Chriſt, ſo but one <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> viz. Chriſt, and but one alſo to leane upon. To this the Apoſtle ſpeakes clearly, <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, even Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. So <hi>unto us there is but one Lord, and one God, even Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. But
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:115802:214"/> one to ſet our love as our Husband; but one alſo to lean on, as our God; but one to be <hi>beloved</hi> as our Husband, but one alſo to <hi>believed</hi> on as our Lord and God. But now to Chriſtleſſe ſoules, there are many <hi>lovers</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,</hi> Jer. 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers,</hi> Hoſ. 2.7. <hi>She ſhall not find her lovers.</hi> A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>lovers,</hi> an indefinite number of <hi>lovers,</hi> untill ſhee returne <hi>unto her firſt Husband;</hi> and therefore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo there <hi>are Gods many, and Lords many,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.5.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Obſervation is,<note place="margin">2ly, The ſouls beloved will be the ſoules leaning-ſtock.</note> 
                     <hi>That whatever is the ſoules beloved, that ever will be found the ſouls leaning-ſtock:</hi> what ever the ſoule loves beſt, on that it will be ſure to <hi>lean moſt:</hi> this is a cleare intimation from the Text <hi>leaning on her beloved.</hi> So that if there be any thing that the ſoule loves more, and better then Chriſt, upon that it will leane, and not upon Chriſt. Now upon this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Accompt, it is eaſie to diſcern in the generall, how <hi>lost ſouls</hi> are hindered from leaning upon Chriſt, becauſe they <hi>have many Gods to lean on,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leane upon the <hi>onely true God manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> yea, and they have many <hi>lovers</hi> and <hi>beloveds</hi> inſtead of Chriſt, which as they lye in their boſomes, where Chriſt onely ſhould lie, ſo ſtand they under their armes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, where Chriſt ſhould be to beare them up. When a ſoule is converted, we muſt with admiration ſing and ſay, <hi>Who is this that comes out of the wilderneſs leaning upon her beloved?</hi> but of others we may take up a <hi>lamentation,</hi> a <hi>Jeremies</hi> ſad ſong, and ſay, <hi>Who are all theſe that go farther and farther into the wilderneſs lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their beloveds?</hi> And as for thoſe that goe downe <hi>into Aegypt,</hi> they have multitudes of <hi>Reeds</hi> to leane upon, many <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> many, even as many as <hi>luſts: Onyons, Fleſhpots, Melons, Cucumers, Idols,</hi> any thing: but when God calls his Sonnes out of Aegypt, then thus, <hi>ſaith the Lord that brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt have none other Gods beſide me.</hi> Many hands
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:115802:215"/> we may have to help us forward (or backward rather) into the wayes of ſinne: But there's not one <hi>arme</hi> for a ſoule to leane unto while it comes from ſinne, but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <hi>arm of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now as we ſay, the <hi>more of thoſe Gods,</hi> the <hi>farther from God;</hi> ſo the more <hi>of theſe leaning-ſtocks,</hi> the farther <hi>from leaning upon the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The four uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all leaning-ſtocks of loſt ſoules.</note>There are particularly foure things which loſt ſoules doe generally more love and leane upon, then Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Sinne, Satan,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe.</hi> And it is to be marked, that ſcriptures charge our uſuall carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in reſpect of theſe, with Idolatry, which is the ſetting of any thing up in Gods roome, to <hi>love</hi> or <hi>lean</hi> upon as God, which is not God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sinne.</note>Firſt, <hi>As for ſin.</hi> It is hence evident that ſinners place that <hi>recumbency</hi> on it, which they ſhould on Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle enumerating the more notorious ſinnes of their unregeneracy, ſummes up all in this one word, <hi>abominable Idolatries:</hi> what were thoſe? why? <hi>Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, luſts, exceſs of Wine, revellings, drunkenneſs, and abominable Idolatries, Wines</hi> are the Drunkards <hi>Idols: Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> the Wantons <hi>Idols: Prophaneneſs</hi> the Revellers <hi>Idol:</hi> Yea, every <hi>new luſt,</hi> a <hi>new Lord;</hi> yea, a <hi>new God:</hi> as hee takes up <hi>new ſin,</hi> he hath <hi>new dependances upon ſinne,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.3. Hence <hi>John</hi> writing to thoſe, that 'tis to be thought were farre enough from groſs Idolatry, concludes, <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children keepe your ſelves from Idols.</hi> Amen. 1 Joh. 5.21.</p>
                  <p>Now you can never <hi>keepe your ſelves from Idols,</hi> except you keepe <hi>your ſelves from ſin.</hi> Sinne ever deales as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſtrange wives,</hi> tempting firſt from the <hi>truſting in the true God,</hi> and next, <hi>to truſting in the falſe.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">3. The world.</note>Thirdly, <hi>As for the World.</hi> 'Tis plainly that which the worldling leans upon inſtead <hi>of God.</hi> Hence thoſe known

                  <p>Fourthly, As <hi>for Selfe.</hi> The <hi>ſelfe-pleaſer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. Selfe.</note> that indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne luſtfull genius, his <hi>belly is his God,</hi> Phil. 3.19. The <hi>ſelf-conceited, ſelf-confident,</hi> and preſumptuous ſinner. <hi>He ſets his heart as the heart of God,</hi> Ezek. 28.6. Strange expreſſions you will ſay, yet are they <hi>Scripture-expreſſions:</hi> you ſee they be; and though many things be imported by them, yet muſt this be a chiefe one, that while Saints <hi>lean on Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>only Lord;</hi> theſe leane upon <hi>Sin, Satan, Mamnon,</hi> and <hi>themſelves.</hi> Of theſe in their order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Hinderance that doth in a poſitive way keepe off ſinners from leaning upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Soules lean upon ſin, and thereby are hindred from leaning upon Chriſt. Proofe of it.</note> is their <hi>leaning upon ſin:</hi> for proof.</p>
                  <p>See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. <hi>This is the man that made not God his truſt, but ſtrengthned himſelf in his wickedneſſe.</hi> What could be more expreſſe for both? ſinners make their wickedneſſe their ſtay, and therefore it is that they make <hi>not God their ſtaie,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.12. <hi>You truſt in oppreſſion, and perverſneſſe, and ſtaie thereon:</hi> It followes, verſe 15. Thus <hi>ſaith the Lord in returning, and reſt you ſhall be ſaved, but ye would not: and in quietneſſe and confidence</hi> (that is, in the <hi>peace of believing) ſhall be your ſtrength, and ye would not.</hi> No, no, they could have both a ſtay and a ſtrength in ſinning, and therefore they would none of Chriſts <hi>reſt</hi> in the way of repenting, or of his quietneſſe and peace in the way of <hi>believing.</hi> 'Tis no wonder, if ſinners can have <hi>Crutches</hi> in a ſinne, that they neglect to ſeeke legges in <hi>a Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that ſinners make ſinne their <hi>leaning-ſtock,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Convictions of it. 1. The careful hold that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners keep of ſinne.</note> I ſhall give you a <hi>two-fold Conviction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>charie,</hi> and <hi>carefull,</hi> and <hi>cordiall,</hi> hold that they keep of ſin. Juſt as a <hi>lame man</hi> holds his <hi>Crutch,</hi> ſo doth a <hi>ſinner</hi> his <hi>ſinne.</hi> The <hi>head</hi> of it is <hi>bolſtered,</hi>
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:115802:216"/> and how neare is it to his heart? There art that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſow <hi>pillowes</hi> under their own and others <hi>arm-holes</hi> for wretched limping ſinners to <hi>lean upon,</hi> Ezek. 13.18. The <hi>lame man</hi> holds his Crutch faſt in his right hand, and will not by any means let it go, as you may ſee the Lord was <hi>Davids leaning-ſtay,</hi> for ſaith <hi>David, I have ſet the Lord at my right hand, therefore I ſhall not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. and that Chriſt was the Spouſes <hi>leaning-ſtay,</hi> for ſhe <hi>held and would not let him go,</hi> Cant. 3.4. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requires the Saints to <hi>hold that faſt</hi> by which they may hold Chriſt faſt, <hi>viz. Holy confidence,</hi> and <hi>the rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of hope,</hi> Heb. 3.6. By which is evinced, that Chriſt and nothing elſe, is the Saints <hi>leaning-ſtock.</hi> So ſinners have their <hi>lies in their right hand</hi> Iſai. 44.20. And they <hi>hold faſt deceit,</hi> and <hi>refuſe to return,</hi> Jer. 8.5. And this is a full Conviction, (your Conſciences beare witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it) that ſinne <hi>is the ſinners leaning-ſtock,</hi> or that in the Prophets language, <hi>The wicked truſt in their wickedneſſe,</hi> Iſai. 47.10. It is ſtrange that a man ſhould dare to ſinne, and then to <hi>truſt in ſin;</hi> but oh! that it were not more true.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">2ly, In that they think that if their ſinne fall, they fall alſo.</note>2ly, In this it is too too manifeſt, that ſinne is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>leaning-ſtock:</hi> in that the ſinner thinkes, <hi>that if his ſin fall, he ſhall fall too.</hi> The reaſon which makes <hi>lame perſons</hi> ſo loath to let their Crutches fall, is becauſe they know that then they ſhall <hi>fall too.</hi> Did they not leane up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them whileſt they ſtand, they would not be affraid of falling with them when they <hi>fall.</hi> Verily ſirs, If your Conſciences beare you this witneſſe, that the reaſon why you doe not let your ſinfull <hi>Alehouſe-maintaining,</hi> or <hi>Alehouſe-keeping,</hi> or <hi>Cheating</hi> fall, is becauſe you think that then you <hi>ſhall fall alſo;</hi> 'tis a plaine Conviction, that your <hi>ſin is your leaning-ſtock.</hi> That of <hi>Diana</hi>'s <hi>ſilver-ſmiths,</hi> is a pregnant inſtance: 'twas a wicked craft that they had, and an helliſh <hi>gain</hi> that they made, <hi>viz.</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inſtruments of abominable <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> to that curſed <hi>vanity of the</hi> Epheſians: Now they make inſurrections
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115802:216"/> againſt the Apoſtles, and this lies at the bottom of all, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.25. that <hi>by this craft we</hi> have our living. They thought it could not be that they ſhould live if they ſhould part with their Idolatry. So ſay <hi>Sinners,</hi> how ſhall we live, if we leave <hi>ſinning. We live by ſelling Malt,</hi> and then <hi>helping the Alehouſes</hi> that <hi>have it from us</hi> to ſuch Company as may again have it from them. How ſhall we live if we leave our lying, diſſembling, cheating, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſinfull compliance with ſinfull men? How ſhall wee live in office, except we be partiall, ſparing the great, and pinching the ſmal: ſparing our Relations, and preſſing others? How ſhall we bear up our Intereſt except we give ſome Countenance to every ſort of men? Do you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the ſilver-Smiths</hi> were angry with <hi>Paul?</hi> why? his Doctrine went about to take away their livelyhood? Do you wonder a <hi>lame man ſhould ſend a curſe</hi> after you, if you come and <hi>ſnatch away</hi> his <hi>Crutch</hi> from under him? Why? he cannot ſtand, if you take away his prop from him; do you <hi>take</hi> Michahs <hi>Gods from him,</hi> (as Judg. 18.24.) and then <hi>do you ask him what he ailes?</hi> Do you go to <hi>take a ſinners ſin</hi> from him which is his prop, his pillar, &amp; ſupport? and then do you wonder that he rails on you, and reviles you? Why? he thinks you go the way to undoe him, he can neither ſtand, nor go without his ſin; let that ſink, and he ſinks with it: And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that powerfull preaching hath many Enemies, few faſt friends; and how plain a conviction is this alſo, that <hi>ſin is indeed the ſinners leaning-ſtock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Poſitive Hindrance that keeps loſt ſoules from <hi>leaning</hi> to Chriſt, is <hi>their leaning to Satan.</hi> This is,<note place="margin">2. Poſ. hind. Sinners lean to Satan. Proof of it.</note> I think, the fulleſt importance of that paſſage. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. <hi>With Hell are we at agreement</hi> (that is by a Metonymy) with the <hi>Devills</hi> of hell) <hi>when the overflowing ſcourge paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thorough, it ſhall not come unto us:</hi> (why? what ſhall ſecure them?) for <hi>we have made lies</hi> (that is Satan the Father of lies) <hi>our refuge, and under falſhood</hi> (that is, under his temptations, though deceitfull ones) <hi>have we
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115802:217"/> hid our ſelves.</hi> Had not <hi>Eve</hi> as this Scripture ſpeaks, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more to the Serpent the Father of falſhood and of lies, then to the <hi>God of truth,</hi> it had not been with us, as it is this day.</p>
                  <p>In two particular, I ſhall declare how ſinners leane upon Satan for their work, and for their wages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. For their work.</note>Firſt, <hi>Sinners lean on Satan for their employment.</hi> This our Saviour ſpeaks out. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8:44. You <hi>are of the Devill, and his luſts you will do:</hi> Satan <hi>wills</hi> and they <hi>work:</hi> Satan <hi>commands</hi> and they <hi>obey.</hi> As much as the Son leans to the Father for <hi>Counſel,</hi> and <hi>command</hi> in his <hi>Employments,</hi> ſo much do you, ſaith Chriſt, to <hi>Satan:</hi> for he <hi>is your Father, and his luſts yee will do;</hi> therefore he is called their Prince: on whom elſe doth the ſubject depend in all his ſervices, for his Commiſſions? He is <hi>the Prince that</hi> rules in <hi>the Children of diſobedience.</hi> Eph. 2.2. It would ſeem a ſtrange Expreſſion, <hi>Rules</hi> in the <hi>Unruly Children.</hi> But it is a true expreſſion; for their being ruled by Satan makes them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly</hi> as to the things of God, <hi>Children of diſobedience</hi> unto God. What doth this mean? Even that as thoſe that work conſtantly with ſome of you <hi>Tradeſmen,</hi> and depend (as you call it) or lean on you, for their <hi>every daies work will not be taken off by any other,</hi> unleſſe upon diſcovery of eminent advantage; ſo (unleſſe God draw them in by a thorough diſcovery of the reall gain of godlineſſe) they wil not obey Gods call, or ſet their hand unto his plough: though we call them, and pray them, and preſſe hard upon them; yet ſirs, to which of theſe Maſters, God, or the Devill, they do lean for their work, and the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their affairs, judge you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. For their wages.</note>Secondly, Sinners lean on Satan for their pay, when according to his luſts they take paines, and for their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges when they have done his work. Therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. <hi>We are at a Covenant with Hell.</hi> Now when a man hath made <hi>Covenants</hi> to do ſo <hi>much work</hi> for <hi>ſo much wages,</hi> unto whom doth he lean for payment but to him whom
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115802:217"/> he covenanted to ſerve? You find Satan called the <hi>Houſe-keeper</hi> amongſt ſinners, <hi>when a ſtrong man arm'd keeps his Houſe</hi> or <hi>Pallace,</hi> Mark. 3.27. and Luk. 11.21. Now to whom doe all the Souldiers in a <hi>Pallace</hi> of Defence, or ſervants in an <hi>Houſe leane</hi> for their <hi>wages</hi> and <hi>pay;</hi> but to him that <hi>keeps the Houſe,</hi> or the <hi>Pallace?</hi> And aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any thing may be drawn from theſe ſcriptures, this may be one thing: That fooliſh ſinners vainly thinke, that in doing the worke as Satan would have them, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will give them ſuch hire as they would have him; and becauſe they are punctuall in performing whatever his Precepts have been to them, that he will alſo be as punctuall in whatever his promiſes have beene to them. Oh! <hi>fooliſh people and unwiſe, lies</hi> are your <hi>leaning-ſtock,</hi> and the <hi>father of them your ſupport.</hi>

                     <hi>But we will remember the name of the Lord:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, [they cannot] you can <hi>never truſt</hi> in the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> while you truſt to Horſes, and unto Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots for war-proviſions; and as for peace-proviſions, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Loe, this is the man that made not God his ſtrength, but truſted in the abundance of his riches.</hi> That was the reaſon he leaned not upon God, becauſe he lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the incomes of the world. So then as to warre or peace, ſtrength in the former, or wealth in the latter, let the abundance be never ſo great, there is no truſting or leaning to either, if you would <hi>lean upon this belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Heare Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.13. <hi>No ſervant can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one,</hi> (what's that but leaning?) <hi>and deſpiſe the other,</hi> (what meanes Chriſt by all this?) <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> ſo Iſai. 31.1. <hi>Woe to them that ſtay on Horſes, and truſt in Chariots, becauſe they are many, and horſemen, becauſe they are ſtrong, but looke not unto the holy one of Iſrael, nor ſeeke the Lord.</hi> What can be plainer? let your Riches in <hi>peace,</hi> or Forces in <hi>warre,</hi> be never ſo augmented, the more you leane unto any of them, the leſſe will you lean to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give you a two-fold word of Conviction for this, <hi>viz.</hi> That worldlings leane upon the World, and therefore not on Chriſt.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Evidence 1.

                  <p>Again, though they ſaid they <hi>were Gods,</hi> they <hi>ſhall die like men:</hi> and though <hi>their heart was ſet as the heart of God,</hi> when the world <hi>went with them;</hi> yet when the world goes <hi>againſt them,</hi> (as you call it) truly then their heart groweth like <hi>Nabals, dead within them,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.37. &amp;c.

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:115802:219"/> another in another, the beſt of them ſay, that <hi>virtue</hi> is the way to that <hi>felicity;</hi> which yet they define not according to the <hi>Scripture-notion</hi> of it, or as identical with <hi>divine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> but an <hi>Habit inherent</hi> in our ſelves, the feeds whereof are from our ſelves alſo, and the ſpringing and fructifying and Maturity of the fruits from our own ſtudious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of what is in us; And who amongſt the wiſeſt of them ever pointed at a Jeſus, as did that Heaven-taught <hi>John Baptiſt.

When Scripture ſaith expreſsly, that the Lord <hi>hath hid the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven from the</hi> wiſe, <hi>and prudent of the World,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, that this is one of the great <hi>Myſteries of Godlineſſe,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould be <hi>believed on in the world.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. that is, that any ſoule ſhould lean for ſalvation to the righteouſneſſe of another. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man receives not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe unto him.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.19. <hi>Even as the wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi> As the Lord knowes thy leaning to the Counſells of thine own heart to be very fooliſhneſſe: So doſt thou naturally think leaning to the Lords Counſell concerning Chriſt to be very fooliſhneſs. What's that to mee? (ſaith thy reaſon) how good ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, what can I be the better? Or how is it poſſible that the <hi>dying of one man</hi> (above ſixteen hundred yeares agoe) ſhall ſave ſo many as expect ſalvation by it now?

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Emnity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</note> Our Unregenerate or carnall mind its not onely fooliſhneſſe, and ſo not able to receive the things
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115802:220"/> of God, but alſo <hi>Emnity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Paul, is it not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can it be.</hi> Now what is the great Goſpel-Law? why, <hi>This is his Commandement that we ſhould believe on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 1 Joh. 3, 23. To this Commandement the <hi>Carnall mind neither is, nor can be ſubject: Lean upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Tell mee what ſay your Carnall minds unto this Commandement? It is obvious to every obſervant eye, that there is not any Commandement of the Law that is more repugnant to <hi>Carnall reaſon,</hi> then this <hi>Law of the Goſpel,</hi> and Carnall reaſon unto it. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the <hi>other heathen Philoſophers</hi> could hit upon an <hi>Ens entium,</hi> a being of beings, and that was ſomewhat like the <hi>firſt Commandement:</hi> and upon a <hi>Deus eſt colendus,</hi> and that is ſomewhat like the <hi>ſecond Command:</hi> They alſo could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>vowes</hi> and <hi>oaths ſacred,</hi> &amp;c. and that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the <hi>third Commandement;</hi> they had ſome <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious feaſts</hi> in ſemblance of the <hi>fourth,</hi> and as for the <hi>ſecond Table of Commandements, Honor Parents, kill not, whore not, ſteal not, lie not,</hi> they could all with open mouth declaim in that Language, and as for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe much could they inveigh againſt it; although the more ſpirituall part of there was too ſublime for them: But as for this Commandement they were ſo far from finding it out themſelves, and the beſt of them deſpiſingly called the Chriſtians <hi>Credentes;</hi> as if <hi>their faith</hi> were their <hi>abſurdity,</hi> wheras God calls all ſuch <hi>unreaſonable</hi> or <hi>abſurd</hi> that <hi>have not Faith.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.2. And thus they made a mock at Jeſus, and that was the very Object of their deſpightfull and <hi>Opprobrious Oppoſition,</hi> which wee know to bee the onely way of our ſalvation, <hi>viz. Leaning upon the Beloved.</hi> Thus their Wiſdome made them <hi>mockers,</hi> and their <hi>mocking made</hi> their <hi>Bonds</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> (as God threatneth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22.) that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was found a more very Enemy to <hi>primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> than that <hi>ſelf-taught Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Philoſophy.</hi> So then it is not onely the <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi> of our
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115802:220"/> heats, but the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of our hearts alſo that flyes in the very face of Goſpell-truth, and cryes out as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Therefore the ſpirit ſaith not, that <hi>the World through fooliſhneſſe knew not God:</hi> But <hi>after that the World through wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God that by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſave them that believe.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. Whence it is evident, that as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſets it ſelfe more directly againſt the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt then the Carnall, Worldly, Naturall mans wiſdom: ſo neither doth that wiſdom oppoſe any thing more then believing in Chriſt, and therefore it accounts the preaching of faith fooliſhneſſe. What (ſaith Carnall Reaſon) will you <hi>take hold</hi> on the <hi>Lord</hi> with <hi>unwaſhed hands?</hi> ſtay, ſtay, till your hands be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and then 'tis more likely that Chriſt will ſuffer you to lean upon him. Yea, but what can <hi>purifie the heart but faith.</hi> And I will lean upon Chriſt, <hi>not becauſe I am holy and like him:</hi> but <hi>that I may be holy and pure as he is pure;</hi> and believe, and reſt upon him, that I may be ſanctified by him, ſuch ſhould the language of faith be.</p>

That of Chriſts is notable to this purpoſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. <hi>When he cometh, ſhall he find faith on the earth?</hi> though this may bee diverſly rendred, yet ſure if it bear reſpect to that which followes, the Explication of faith in this place is according to this preſent truth.

For this leaning to ſelf-righteouſnes keeps the ſoul ignorant of at a diſtance from, yea, in open hoſtility againſt the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">As being 1. Ignorant of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> Self-righteouſneſſe keeps the ſoul igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods Righteouſneſs, and did eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> theſe are link'd together, I have ſeen ſome Country youth (that never was in any Populous and Gentile City or Towne) trickt up with a new ſuite of Cloaths, and a few gay Ribbons; None in the Pariſh ſo gay as he, and he not uſing to go out of the Town, hath thought that one could not bee more ſpruce then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: His own ſpruceneſſe hath kept him ignorant of the tranſcendent Riches and ſplendor of Rayment in other places, which when once he comes to ſee, he is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he knew not what belonged to good Cloaths before. So the ſelf-righteous; they are ſo fine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their duties, their gifts, and eſpecially in their holyday-'parrell, their Temple-prayers, and Lords-day Duties and thankſgiving-day alms in the corners of the ſtreets; and with the ſound of the Trumpet, that they know not what belongs to a righteouſneſſe to make it up more compleat. And reciprocally the more they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods Righteouſneſſe, the more they eſtabliſh their own: and the more they, eſtabliſh their own, the more ignorant they are of the Righteouſneſſe of God. Ah! but when they are once come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>City of the living God, the place of Concourſe,</hi> unto <hi>holy Saints</hi> and <hi>glorious Angels,</hi> never did they ſee the thouſandth part of that diſproportion between the glittering of a tinſell Ribbon, and the ſparkling of a Diamond in a ſet of Gold, which they now behold betwixt ſelf-righteouſneſſe and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:115802:223"/> the righteouſneſſe of the Saints which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If ſelf-righteouſneſſe be near meeting with Chriſts, if it be poſſible it will ſhun it. Never was Copper more affraid to be compared with pure Gold,<note place="margin">2. Shunning Chriſts.</note> which when it was alone might go for Gold, then ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to be compared with Chriſts. Oh! what a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work was it for <hi>John</hi> to get the Phariſees to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt. 'Twas much more eaſie (which would ſeem ſtrang) to get the unclean harlots, and unrighteous Publicans to come to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that had none of their owne, then the Phariſees that had one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Saith Chriſt to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>John came to you in the way of righteouſneſs, and you believed him not, but the harlots and Publicans believed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If ſelf-righteouſneſſe muſt needs meet with Chriſts,<note place="margin">3. Warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts.</note> as long as it is able to ſtand, it will be ſure to fight for it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>they eſtabliſh their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>have not ſubmitted to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> I know not any Engine or weapon that morall, and civill, eſpecially formall ones war more againſt Chriſt by, then this ſelf-righteouſnes. When the ſtrong man arm'd keeps his Palace, hee is the ſtronger for this that his goods are in peace. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. What <hi>peace ſo long as his ſpirituall whoredoms remain?</hi> Why? yes. A ſelf-peace ſpun out of the bowels of ſelf-righteouſneſſe: as true righteouſneſs is the ground of reall peace, ſo is counterfeit-righteouſneſs of falſe peace: and this peace is that which arms Satan to keep garriſon in the ſoul. Therefore the Lord yoaks truſting in <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs, with committing iniquity</hi> Ezek. 33.13.</p>

                     <note place="margin">4. Leaning to our owne lives.</note>Laſtly, Leaning to the length of our own lives will bee exceeding ready to hinder us from leaning upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. You heard <hi>Jacob</hi> had a ſtaffe to lean upon in his dying hour: and ſoules that prepare for, or ſeriouſly, and frequently remember death will get a Chriſt to lean upon in that hour. But while you read in one ſcripture of ſome that <hi>put the evill day far from them</hi> (as Amos 6.3.) 'tis
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115802:223"/> no wonder that you read in others, that ſome there are that ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from</hi> us (as <hi>Job</hi> 21.14.) or that Chriſt <hi>ſhould come to his own</hi> (according to the fleſh) and <hi>they not receive him,</hi> (as Joh. 1.11. You have a notable paſſage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou haſt found thy life of thine hand, therefore thou haſt not grieved. Men find their lives in their own hands,</hi> therefore they have not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; [therefore] Though all our Times are alwaies in Gods hand, yet vaine men ordinarily think they are in their own hands; as in time of health and proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now in ſickneſſe they fooliſhly think (yet is there ſomething in it) that their lives are in the Phyſitians hand, if he (through inconſiderateneſs or haſt) miſtake a glaſs, or a Gally-pot they may die for it: Oh! now they are grieved, how glad would they now be, that they had but a firm hold upon the Lord Jeſus? So I have ſeen at Sea, when the vaineſt of our company have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by a ſtorm, that ours lives were in Gods hand, and not in our own: When our tacklings have been looſed, and we could not well ſtrengthen the Maſt; oh! how fain would we all of us then have had an Intereſt in this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and hope in this Chriſt as the Anchor of our ſouls, when we could not caſt anchor with our ſhips; to have a Maſter to lean upon, When our Maſt reeled, and wee ſtaggered like drunken men, and were ready to ſinke in the deep Waters. Oh! What crying out with <hi>Peter; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! ſave us we periſh;</hi> Lord Jeſus, <hi>We ſink, we ſink,</hi> we are at our wits ends, <hi>Lord ſave us.</hi> But as ſoon as we were ſafe on ſhoar again, though our lives were new given us even for a prey; yet then fell wee to our former courſe of ſin, ſelf-confidence, and vain converſation, having ſmall care of faith, or holineſs; Chriſt is now little beloved, little believed: little thought upon, little lean'd upon. Thus whileſt we lean upon any thing of SELF, there is little leaning to this beloved. All this have I ſpoken to you for the ſelf ſame end that thoſe ſad providences ſpake to <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That you might not

                     <note place="margin">1. Not to what the men of the world can do.</note>Firſt, Lean not to the Men of the World. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5.<hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the man that truſteth in man, or maketh fleſh his Arm.</hi>

                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:115802:228"/>2ly. Lean not to the <hi>Things of the World.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Nor the things of the world.</note> 
                     <hi>Charge them that be rich in this world, that they truſt not in riches.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17.</p>
                  <p>True may you ſay, men are not to be lean'd to, in whom we have no <hi>intereſt,</hi> but ſuch a man is <hi>my friend,</hi> my Brother. But truſt not in a friend. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.5. And againe men will think ſmall friends, ſmall forces are not much to be confided in: Small means, they that have them may live to waſt them, and too dye beggers notwithſtanding them. But think men if our friends, or our Armies were ſo great, or our Navies ſo ſtrong, or our Eſtates ſo many Thouſands, and that an Annuity, then might I truſt and that with boldneſſe unto theſe things. Therefore I wil go over again.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Lean not to the men of the World,<note place="margin">Not the great men of the world.</note> no not to the Ableſt, the Strongeſt, the Greateſt that is in the World. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Wo be to them, That ſtay on horſes, and truſt in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are many,</hi> and <hi>in Horſmen, becauſe they are very ſtrong,</hi> Pſal. 146.3. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of man, in whom there is no help. It is better to</hi> truſt <hi>in the Lord then to put confidence in</hi> man. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 118.8. That you'l quickly grant. Yea, but it follwes. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, then to put confidence in Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Lean not to the things of the Word:<note place="margin">Nor great things of the world.</note> No not to the greateſt, to the fulleſt, to the certaineſt enjoyment of theſe things. Truſt not in Riches, boaſt not of them; lean not to them, no, <hi>not to the multitude of your Riches.</hi> Pſa. 49.6. <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them.</hi> Iſa. 62.10. That is, lean not unto them, for though <hi>wee ought not to ſet our loves upon them,</hi> and that may be there forbidden; yet I believe the ſpeciall meaning is, that we ſhould not repoſe the truſt of our hearts in them, which I gather both from what goes before both in the eighth and ninth Verſes, <hi>Truſt in him at all times;</hi> why ſo? why? <hi>Men of high degree are a lie: therefore if riches encreaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> as alſo from what followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115802:229"/> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>This God hath ſpoken, twice have I heard it, That power belongs onely to God. Therefore ſet not your hearts on riches;</hi> the Encreaſe whereof hath no power to ſupport you. And yet wherewithall ſhall I diſſwade you, worldlings, from leaning to the World? Conſider, there is but little in all the World for your ſupport, ſhould you lean upon it. And that little ſtrength that theſe Reeds have, wil upon your leaning bee ſure to break in pieces, and then what were thy Crutches before, ſhall then become thy firebrands.<note place="margin">Diſſwaſives. 1. There is but little in the things or men of the world to ſupport for.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is but little in Worldly things to bee leaned unto, which may eaſily appeare under theſe Conſiderations. They are unſuitable, uncertaine unſatisfactory, unſerviceable ſupports to thy poore ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. They are unſuitable ſupports.</note>Firſt, Unſuitable: The actings of the ſoul which I here call leaning, are the Outgoings of a ſpirituall ſubſtance, therefore how improper an Object are Carnall things? How unapt a leaning ſtock is a fleſhly Arm for a ſpiritual hand? God ſaith, that he ſpake like a fool, that ſaid, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, or reſt O ſoul, for I have laid up much goods.</hi> Luk. 12.19, 20. If he had ſaid, heres a <hi>table to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my body,</hi> heres a <hi>bed to refreſh my bones,</hi> it had not been ſuch height of folly; But <hi>ſoul, take thine eaſe!</hi> this was the fooliſhneſſe, and perhaps is thine. <hi>David</hi> was wiſer then ſo, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 141.8. <hi>O God, the Lord, in thee do I truſt, leave not my ſoul deſtitute.</hi> Whatever of theſe things thou truſteſt to, yea, whomſoever of theſe Perſons; yet may thy ſoul be deſtitute for all them; the <hi>Lord is onely my ſupport,</hi> let thy ſoul ſing; for <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6, 7, 8. <hi>They that truſt in their Wealth, and boaſt in the multitude of their Riches, none of them can by any means redeem his Brother, nor, give to God a Ranſome for him; for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul is pretious, and ceaſeth for ever.</hi> Meat may ſupport the outward man, Money the outward Eſtate, Phyſick may repair the ſtrength of the Body; but the ſoul is out of the reach of theſe things.</p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:115802:229"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Uncertain. Such are the things of the world,<note place="margin">2. Uncertain.</note> therefore not to be lean'd unto. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Truſt not in uncertain riches.</hi> Such are the men of the World. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73.18. <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places.</hi> Certainly they are in uncertain places: ſlippery places; their heads are a loſt to day, their heeles as high as their heads to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. They are great men, and thy great friends, and thou leaneſt confidently on them great things, and perhaps they intend thee ſo; but between the writing of the Will and the ſubſcription, between the draught of the Commiſſion, and ſetting of the Seal, hee is ſnatch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou remaineſt as thou waſt. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 136.3, 4. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of man, in whom is no help.</hi> How comes that? Why? <hi>his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth, in that very day his thoughts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> But as for the beloved, lean on him; for as he was, ſo he abides, and ſo ſhall he abide for ever. So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18.2. <hi>The Lord is my Rock, in whom I will truſt, the Lord is my high Tower.</hi> A ſtrong guard you will ſay both in Front and Rear, a Rock before, an high Tower behind, and his confidence comes marching in the middle. Among all things made by the Art of man, nothing is more durable, certain, ſtable, then a Tower of Defence. Among all things (viſible) made by the hand of God himſelfe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abiding, ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable then a Rock. God is as both; therefore wil <hi>David</hi> lean upon him: here's an unmoveable ſupport, a ſit leaning-ſtock for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unſatisfactory.<note place="margin">3. Unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> They that labour for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or for wicked things lay out their labour for that which ſatisfieth not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. and therefore they that lean upon them, ſhall never have any ſatisfying ſupport from them. Which of you are more ſatisfied with your thousands then you were, when you were worth but hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds? who of you ſaith, I have enough to <hi>ſit down upon,</hi> and to reſt fully contented with? A Saint may ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33.11. <hi>I have enough my Brother, yea,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:115802:230"/> I have all <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for I have the beloved, who filleth all in al.</hi> Eph. 1.23. but who beſides the Saint can ſay ſo? Thoſe of you that have much goods wax unwearied in getting more, and they that have great Eſtates in getting greater, and they that have good friends (as to worldly account) in procuring better, yea, they tire themſelves on their beds of reſt whereon they lean; <hi>and this their way is their folly, and yet their poſterity approves their ſayings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note>Fourthly, And laſtly, Unſerviceable. When is it that we ſay ſuch a thing would do us a great deale of ſervice, but when we have moſt need of it? And if ſo, Then are the men and the things of the World unſerviceable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to the poor ſoul. As for worldly men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.7. <hi>None of them can by any means redeem his Brother,</hi> &amp;c. And as for worldly things, when we have moſt need, have they leaſt help; for <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath, (but Righteouſneſſe delivers from death)</hi> Pro. 11.4. In daies of health, &amp; peace and proſperity, when thou art able to help thy ſelf &amp; friends, thou haſt many that are willing to help thee: then Riches will proffer their ſervice to thee; But when you ſhall be under the greateſt want of help; Then comes that cutting Queſtion to bee ſtated againſt thee. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20. <hi>then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be?</hi> That is, if they were thine before, they ſhall not now be thine, when thou moſt needeſt ſome ſupport. But lean unto the Lord, who is a preſent help in the time of trouble, yea, a very preſent help, therefore let him be thy preſent refuge, and thy very ſtrength, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 46.1. Remember thine owne Experiences, and truſt in him, yea, what thy Fathers have ſaid unto thee. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22.4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Leaning on them will break their ſhoulders, and ſo they will loſe the little ſtrength they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have.</note> 
                     <hi>and thou didſt deliver them. They cryed unto thee, and were delivered, they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That proportion of ſtrength that the Lord hath given unto any Creature to ſerve thee, thou takeſt the moſt certain and ready courſe to deſpoyle it off, if thou deſigneſt that it ſhould ſupport thee. The Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115802:230"/> that theſe ſhould (in their degree) bee thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but never that they ſhould be thy Confidences. <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.7. <hi>Becauſe thou truſtedſt in thy works, and Treaſures, thou ſhalt be taken, and the ſhall go into Captivity.</hi> You may uſe them, and ſtill hold them, but if you truſt in them, you ſink them. Of all things nothing is more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to man then Bread and Water; yet if you make bread the ſtaffe of your life, and doe not make God the ſtaffe of your Bread, the Lord threatens, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1. <hi>That he will take away the ſtay, and the ſtaffe, the whole stay of bread, and the whole ſtay of water.</hi> He doth not ſay, hee will take away the bread and water, but the ſtay of them; which he may do, though he leave them with you. You may eat as <hi>Pharoahs lean kine the fat,</hi> and yet be never the more nouriſhed, untill you come to know that <hi>Man lives not by bread alone, but by the word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> Mat. 4.4.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Sirs of all things that I know in the World, I know none ſo heavy and weighty as ſin, and faith. Sin is ſuch a weight that would ſink the whole Creation to hell and ruine, did not God as well as Man undertake to bear the burthen of it. Faith is ſuch a weight, that if it be not objected upon the Creator, it can not but ſink the moſt Potent Creature. What is it that hath ſunk ſo many Popular men, and Eminent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Common-wealth, but that they have beene the Common confidence? Lean upon Parliaments, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or Navies; though the beſt accompliſhed, and moſt hopefull in the World, and you preſently break their ſhoulders. There's not a readier way in the World to ſinke the Miniſter in his abilities, gifts, or ſucceſſe; yea, to ſink his life alſo into the grave, then to lean upon him. Set thine heart upon thy wife, thy friend, thy child, if thou wouldſt fain love them to death, and kill them with kindneſſe. If thou haſt a deſire to break thine Eſtate to pieces, then ſet thine <hi>heart upon thy Riches. This I have found, and ſearch thou it, and know it for thy good,</hi> That I have never been ſo near the grant, or continuance of any
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:115802:231"/> of theſe enjoments, as when the Lord hath brought mine heart to a kind (I ſay not of liſtleſſe careleſſe, but) of yielding indifferency: Lean thou not upon any of theſe things which are but Reeds, leſt the harder thou hold, the ſooner they break, and the heavier thy fall be. I have ſeen an heavy lad ſlide lightly over an Ice, when a leſſe weight hath broken it by preſſing hard upon it. Worldly places (as you heard) are ſlippery, or Icy places, and therefore take the Apoſtles Counſell. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30. <hi>Let thoſe that have wives, be as if they had none, and thoſe that buy as if they poſſeſſed not, and they that uſe the world as not abuſing it; for the faſhion of this world paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. If you make them your Crutches God will make theſe Crurches your fire-brands.</note>Thirdly, If you make them your Crutches, God will make theſe Crutches your fire-brands. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.3. <hi>The ſtrength of Pharaoh ſhall be your ſhame,</hi> and <hi>the truſt in the ſhaddow of Aegypt your Confuſion.</hi> Becauſe you have had and have truſted (for it is not the bare having that ſhall be thus puniſhed) unto your own good things here, therefore ſhall you be tormented, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>and your Gold and Silver ſhall eat your fleſh as fire,</hi> Ja. 5.3. And that which you have called ſtrong, and made your ſtrength ſhall be as tow, and you <hi>the makers of it as a ſpark, and you shall both burn together, and none shall quench you.</hi> Iſa. 1.31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note>I have been the longer ſpeaking to this laſt particular, becauſe I find not onely that this is the great ſin of our times, but even of Gods own people. They dare not make Covenants plainly with hell; yet dare they confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with Earth, and they that dare not lean to ſinfull ſupports, yet are they not ſo ſhie of carnall Confidences. Even gracious <hi>Joſiah</hi> leans to <hi>Garchemish,</hi> though hee die for it. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. and good <hi>Aſah</hi> relies on the King of <hi>Syria.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. rather then on the Lord, and <hi>in his his diſeaſe ſeeks, and truſts unto Phyſitians, rather then the Lord.</hi> ver. 12. <hi>But yet ſo far forth as the ſoul is Married</hi> unto the Lord: 'Tis a widdow to the world: and ſo
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:115802:231"/> farre as it is a Widdow indeed, it will be deſolate (that is, as in a Wilderneſſe in it ſelfe) and therefore <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.5.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Is ſin a Wilderneſſe? Chriſt is the <hi>Way.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Walk in him,</hi> And you ſhall find <hi>REST</hi> to your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>This is certain, that the ſaving Recumbency whereof we have ſpoken doth import the walking in Chriſt as well as walking with him: ſince it is manifeſt (as you ſhall perceive) that this Beloved is a Way as well as a Guide, and to be walked in as a Way, as well as walked with as a Guide; For if it be evident in Scripture as it is, that we are both to go with him and in him, 'tis a
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115802:235"/> plain caſe that he is both a Guide and a Way; and if we muſt lean upon him under each Notion, it is as plaine that we muſt walk in him as well as with him. Hence it is that the Saints are ſaid ſometimes to follow Chriſt, (<hi>viz.</hi> as their Guide) as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. hence thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are taxed for <hi>walking no more with him.</hi> Joh. 6.66. And hence alſo it is, that (as I exhorted you in the firſt part of this diſcourſe to labour to finde your ſoules as a <hi>Garden of walks unto Chriſt,</hi> as himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>I will walk in them.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16.) we are called here to walke in him: <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him.</hi> Col. 2.6. (<hi>viz.</hi> as your way.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt though a Guide is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the way.</note>And this is no novell notion, no paradox to a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized underſtanding, that the ſame ſhould bee both the Guide and the way. For thus it is with the Spirit, and thus with the word of the Lord. <hi>David</hi> calls the Word <hi>a light to his feet, a Lanthorn to his paths.</hi> Pſa. 119.105. this is that counſell of God which the Pſalmiſt makes his Guide. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.24. and the ſame word <hi>David</hi> calls his way. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> and Verſe 33. <hi>Teach me the way of thy Statutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it is alſo with the Spirit. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>When the Spirit is come, he will guide you into all truth:</hi> there is hee expreſſed to be a Guide. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Walk in the Spirit:</hi> there he is ſuppoſed to be a way.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner that Chriſt whom you have heard the Scriptures declaring to be a Guide, calls himſelfe (as you ſhall hear) a way. That is, the Word of truth ſhews us both where and how to walk: The ſpirit of truth ſhews us both in what way and according to what Rule we ought to walk. Chriſt finally (who is the truth) leads us by himſelf as he is the Guide, to walk in himſelf as he is the way that brings us to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Where I ſhall obſerve unto you: That as <hi>Iſraels</hi> Guides, ſo their way to <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type of Chriſt; as our way

                  <p>The are two things to be conſidered in Chriſt (which were alſo both in <hi>Moſes</hi>) enabling him (as was <hi>Moſes</hi>) to be a Guide.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he be a <hi>Prophet;</hi> that is, One able to direct the <hi>Way,</hi> ſo was <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he be a <hi>Prince;</hi> that is, One having power to <hi>command into that way ſo directed,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In both theſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of Chriſt as a Guide. Chriſts Office being Propheticall to Direct, and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Command ſoules to walke in the wayes that hee ſhewes them. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was a fit Guide, and ſo is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But then there is another requiſite to make Chriſt the <hi>guide,</hi> to be the way alſo, (and in this <hi>Moſes</hi> came ſhort of typifying Chriſt, but <hi>Aaron</hi> by whom they were alſo led, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.20. Though ſhort before, makes up that defect now) and that is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that he be a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> The <hi>people were not to offer ſacrifices immediatly, or by themſelves; but they were to bring them to the Prieſts, and the Prieſts were to be their way unto the Lord,</hi> and all as cleare Types
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115802:236"/> of Chriſt our way to the <hi>Father.</hi> Now then had Chriſt been onely <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> he might have been an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>guide;</hi> but he could not have been a <hi>waie,</hi> but Chriſt being <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> the chiefe of <hi>Kings,</hi> the chiefe of <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the chiefe of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> muſt needs be the chiefe of <hi>Guides,</hi> and the chiefe of <hi>Waies.</hi> I thinke the Scripture's very plaine, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.6. Jeſus ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> I will expound, or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe it thus, <hi>I am the King, the Prieſt, and the Prophet;</hi> for I thinke thoſe three words in the Text, anſwer the Threefold office conſiderable in Chriſt. <hi>I am the truth,</hi> (that's) I am the <hi>Prophet: I am the life,</hi> (thats) <hi>I am the Prince: I am the waie,</hi> that's, I am the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> That Chriſt as he ſtiles himſelfe the Truth, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto his Propheticall Office, none (I thinke) will deny: that Chriſt as he ſtiles himſelfe the <hi>life,</hi> that is, one <hi>giving life</hi> to his people, ſpeakes of his Kingly <hi>Office,</hi> may as well be granted: for this is the peculiar prerogative of Chriſt, as <hi>King</hi> above all other <hi>Kings;</hi> other Kings can bid people goe, &amp;c. but Chriſt by bidding them, can them goe; and this is, without all contradiction, Chriſts very Kingly Office, to give ſuch commands in the new Creation, as God the Lord did in the Old, he ſaid, <hi>let there be light,</hi> and <hi>there was</hi> ſo: ſo Chriſt to <hi>Lazarus, Come forth,</hi> and he did ſo: ſo to the Diſeaſed, Take <hi>up your bed and walk,</hi> and they did ſo: and ſo Chriſt to the Spouſe, <hi>Come with me from the Lyons den, &amp;c.</hi> Cant. 4.8. and ſhe doth ſo, as in our Text. Therefore is the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Jeſus Chriſt, (as Truth and Prophet, he ſhews the way, as Prince he gives life (the fountaine of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to walke in that way. Otherwiſe he might call and command ten thouſand times, and we ſtirre no more then dead Carkaſſes. Other Kings can onely ſpare, or take away life where it is, but Chriſt can give life where it is not.</p>
                  <p>There wants yet another word to ſpeake Chriſts <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office,</hi> and that's the firſt, <hi>I am the way;</hi> for Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115802:237"/> 
                     <hi>Prieſt,</hi> is as truly his peoples way unto the <hi>Father,</hi> as being <hi>Prophet,</hi> he doth bring truth; or being <hi>Prince,</hi> life from God unto them.</p>

Wherefore never tell me of thy prayers unleſſe Chriſt be in thy prayers, or of thine Alms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Chriſt be in them; they are the waies, but Chriſt it the way; and in them you muſt ſeek him.

If men walk in private paths they are treſpaſſers, and may be arreſted; and verily whilſt the ſoul is void of Chriſt, it commits daily treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, what ever it doth, even when its eats its daily bread.

                  <p>This is the Inheritance of the Saints in light, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away, but is reſerved in the Heavens for them.</p>
                  <p>This is their Habitation made, but not with <hi>hands,</hi> and purchaſed, but not with <hi>money.</hi> This is their Reſt prepared by Chriſts travailes, their <hi>life,</hi> purchaſed by his <hi>Death;</hi> the joy of the Lord dearely paid for by that <hi>Man of ſorrowes,</hi> their Glory bought by his <hi>ſhame;</hi> their true Riches gained through his <hi>povertie;</hi> the Kingdome wonne for them by his <hi>ſubjection,</hi> the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> obtained through his being made as a Curſe for them.</p>

                  <p>This is the HOME whereunto Chriſt is the WAY, In and By whom, whileſt the Ranſomed of <hi>the Lord</hi> come up from the Wilderneſſe, they ſhall obtaine <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gladneſſe,</hi> and ſorrow and ſighing <hi>ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot ſay but Chriſtleſſe ſinners have got as many Guidles as there are SATYRS, and as many waies as there are windings in the Wilderneſſe, and they alſo make haſt to their own home; for <hi>Judas</hi> who hanged himſelf, is ſaid to go (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>He that is in Chriſt goes home to be comforted, but the Chriſtleſſe to be tormented: he to his good things, but thou (O wretch!) from thy good things.

He may complain, Abroad the ſword bereaveth; but thou ſhalt lament, <hi>At home there is as death</hi> (he cannot ſay ſo) <hi>As death</hi> I ſay, but <hi>worſe thou death:</hi> Where thou ſhalt ſue for life (like <hi>Haman</hi>) but it ſhall be denyed thee; and then thou ſhalt <hi>ſeek for Death but Death ſhall flye from thee.</hi> Thou ſhalt <hi>neither live nor die, but live to die,</hi> and that to eternity. This is thine End, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is endleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thou ſhall cry, yea ſadly ſhalt thou cry an end is come, but O that there were an end. I dye, I periſh; But O that I could periſh; If thou wilt not ſave me, Lord kill me, but he will do neither, O let the Mountaines fall on me, and let the hills cover me from thy preſence, and from the face of the Lamb; and this is the only Petition that ſhall be granted thee, but in a ſad ſenſe, for Mountains of wrath ſhall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and everlaſting hills of Gods diſpleaſure ſhall hide thee (I will warrant thee) from the face of his pitty, and from the preſence of his glory. Then ſhalt call to <hi>Abraham</hi> for a drop, but receive a River,

O! take it for a warning, thou wretch, thy Father the Devill is making a ſcourg for thee of his own chain, and thou'ſt find it ſo when hee gets thee in, though he flatter thee home: thy fellow ſervants that are in the ſame Condemnation with thee, are prepared to ſmite thee; yea, when thou comeſt home, then ſhall thine owne Conſcience ſpeak home; &amp; becauſe thou haſt been a ſelf-Murtherer, therefore ſhalt thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a ſelf-tormentor: Ah Satan! ſhalt thou ſay, <hi>Is this thy Fatherhood to thy Children;</hi> is this the <hi>beſt hire</hi> thou <hi>giveſt thy ſervants, is this thy kindneſs to thy friend?</hi> Ah ſirs! are you the men that I called good fellowes, was I thus miſtaken in you? am I thus rewarded by you: Ah! how I ſpent my Eſtate, my Time, my Soule upon you; how I loſt the company of Saints to gaine yours, the favour of God to gain yours; how I diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Conſcience to pleaſe your corruptions. And do you thus requite my poor ſoul: Oh cruel people and unkind! Then ſhalt thou cry to thy Conſcience, ah, <hi>why didst not thou ſpeak and warn me, that I might not have come into this place of torment;</hi> but thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall reply, Ah wretch! <hi>Why didſt not thou hear? how often did I call but thou gaveſt me no anſwer, but ſlightedſt all my Counſell, and wouldſt none of my reproof:</hi> Thou ſhalt accuſe thy Conſcience, and thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall accuſe thee: Thou ſhalt accuſe thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and they thee, thou ſhalt accuſe the ſerpent, and the ſerpent ſhall accuſe thee. Then ſhalt thou look on the one hand, and refuge faileth thee, and on the other, and there is none careth for thy ſoul: Thou ſhalt look to thy Merchants with whom thou haſt laboured from thy youth, <hi>but they wander to their Quarters, None

I have treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you up againſt the latter daies, and will you now leave my ſoul in Hell, and ſuffer one that loved you ſo dearly to ſee corruption?

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore let me earneſtly exhort you ſeriouſly to ask your ſoules this one Queſtion, which is the home that I am haſting to? Hell or Heaven, for there is not a third beſide the grave; and the grave is but thy long home, but theſe are the everlaſting homes: if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but how, ſhall I know? 'tis ſoon anſwered; if Chriſt be thy Way, Heaven is thy Home, and if <hi>any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature;</hi> but, and if the Wilderneſſe be thy Way, the place of Howling is thy Home; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go to now, lament and Howl for the miſeries that ſhall come upon thee before the, Evill daies come wherein thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other Uſes might be made of this point. <hi>viz.</hi> If there be no ſalvation for loſt ſinners but onely by leaning upon the Lord Jeſus,</p>
                  <p>How may this inform us of inavailableneſs of all their ſupports, of the folly of leaning on them.</p>
                  <p>How may this confute the Popiſh recumbency on the merits of our own Works, our leaning to the Angells, to the Virgin-Mother of our Lord, or any other of the Saints; and all reliance on the light of our own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or might of our own wils; as alſo any expectancy of ſalvation in any other Religion that teacheth not Chriſt to bee <hi>the onely or the all ſufficient Saviour of loſt ſinners.</hi>

                  <p>And on the other hand, how great Encouragement to ſuch as onely love and leane upon Jeſus Chriſt to a fixedneſſe of heart whilſt you truſt in the Lord.</p>
